# Carly Rae Jepsen — Deep Dive

## Overview

Carly Rae Jepsen is a Canadian singer-songwriter from Mission, British Columbia, who has become one of the most critically acclaimed pop craftspeople of her generation. Born November 21, 1985, Jepsen first gained public attention as a third-place finalist on Canadian Idol Season 5 (2007), then exploded into global consciousness with "Call Me Maybe" (2012) — a single that topped charts in 19 countries, sold over 20 million copies worldwide, and became one of the best-selling digital singles of all time.

What makes Jepsen remarkable is what happened after "Call Me Maybe." Rather than chasing mainstream radio with formula replicas, she pivoted toward a deeply personal vision of 1980s-influenced synth-pop, crafting some of the most critically revered pop music of the 2010s and 2020s. Her 2015 album E·MO·TION became a cult classic — a word-of-mouth phenomenon that transformed her from a perceived one-hit wonder into a pop auteur with a devoted, almost evangelical fanbase. Critics who had dismissed "Call Me Maybe" as disposable bubblegum found themselves writing essays about her as a songwriter of rare emotional intelligence.

Jepsen is known for her relentless perfectionism, reportedly writing over 200 songs for E·MO·TION and keeping only 12 for the standard edition. Her work is defined by emotional maximalism — enormous feelings delivered through meticulously constructed pop productions — and a vocal style that balances breathless vulnerability with joyful abandon. She treats pop music as a serious art form while never losing its essential quality of fun.

## Discography

### Tug of War (2008)

- **Label:** MapleMusic Recordings (Canada only)
- **Context:** Released following her Canadian Idol appearance. Folk-pop and acoustic singer-songwriter material. Limited to Canadian distribution.
- **Sound:** Acoustic folk-pop, jangly guitar, intimate vocals. Very different from her later synth-pop direction. Closer to Feist or early Colbie Caillat than anything she'd become known for.
- **Key tracks:** "Tug of War," "Bucket," "Sour Candy"
- **Chart:** #17 on Canadian Albums Chart.
- **Significance:** Debut album. Won Juno Award nomination for New Artist of the Year. Shows her songwriting roots before the pop transformation.

### Curiosity (2012) — EP

- **Released:** February 14, 2012
- **Label:** 604 Records / School Boy Records / Interscope
- **6 tracks**
- **Sound:** Transition from folk-pop to pop. Includes the original recording of "Call Me Maybe" that went viral.
- **Key tracks:** "Call Me Maybe," "Curiosity," "Picture"
- **Significance:** Bridge release. "Call Me Maybe" was already spreading virally in Canada when Justin Bieber tweeted about it in January 2012, catapulting it globally.

### Kiss (2012)

- **Released:** September 18, 2012
- **Label:** 604 Records / School Boy Records / Interscope
- **Producer:** Matthew Wilder (primary), Josh Ramsay, Reilly, others
- **Sound:** Mainstream dance-pop and bubblegum pop. Major-label production aiming to capitalize on "Call Me Maybe" momentum. Polished, bright, radio-focused. Widely considered her weakest album critically — Jepsen herself has acknowledged it was more label-driven than artist-driven.
- **Key tracks:** "Call Me Maybe," "Good Time" (with Owl City), "This Kiss," "Tonight I'm Getting Over You"
- **Chart:** #6 on Billboard 200. "Call Me Maybe" hit #1 in 19 countries.
- **Commercial:** "Call Me Maybe" sold over 20 million copies globally. Diamond-certified in US (10x Platinum). One of the best-selling digital singles of all time.
- **Significance:** Global breakthrough. The album itself was commercial but not critically embraced, setting up the dramatic artistic leap of E·MO·TION.

### E·MO·TION (2015)

- **Released:** June 24, 2015 (Japan), August 21, 2015 (worldwide)
- **Label:** 604 Records / School Boy Records / Interscope
- **Producers:** Ariel Rechtshaid, Dev Hynes, Rostam Batmanglij, Greg Kurstin, Patrik Berger, Mattman & Robin, others
- **Sound:** 1980s-influenced synth-pop, new wave revival, and disco-pop. Lush synthesizer arrangements, driving beats, soaring melodies, and Jepsen's voice pushed to its most expressive. The album is a sustained rush of euphoria, longing, and romantic ecstasy — every song sounds like the best moment of a night out. Production references Cyndi Lauper, Madonna's True Blue era, Janet Jackson's Control, and Robyn's Body Talk.
- **Key tracks:** "Run Away with Me" (the saxophone intro became iconic), "I Really Like You," "E·MO·TION," "Boy Problems," "All That," "When I Needed You," "Warm Blood"
- **Chart:** #16 on Billboard 200. Commercial underperformance relative to Kiss.
- **Critical reception:** Near-universal acclaim. Pitchfork: 7.4 (later reassessed higher in decade-end lists). Rolling Stone: 4/5. Named one of the best pop albums of the decade by numerous publications. NPR called it "a masterpiece of pop songwriting." Retroactively recognized as one of the defining pop albums of the 2010s.
- **The "200 songs" story:** Jepsen reportedly wrote and recorded over 200 songs during the E·MO·TION sessions, keeping only 12 for the standard edition (plus bonus tracks). This became a key part of her mythos — a songwriter so devoted to quality that she'd discard 90%+ of her work.
- **Significance:** The album that transformed her reputation. Commercial disappointment that became a cult classic through word-of-mouth, critical championing, and internet culture. Proved that "Call Me Maybe" was not a fluke but a small sample of extraordinary pop instincts.

### E·MO·TION Side B (2016) — EP

- **Released:** August 26, 2016
- **8 tracks of B-sides from the E·MO·TION sessions**
- **Sound:** Consistent quality with the main album. Fans and critics argued several tracks (particularly "Cry," "Store," and "Higher") could have been A-sides.
- **Key tracks:** "Cut to the Feeling" (added to streaming versions; became her second-most-iconic song), "Cry," "Store," "Higher"
- **Significance:** "Cut to the Feeling" — originally recorded for the animated film Ballerina/Leap! — became a gay anthem and one of her most celebrated songs. The quality of these "rejects" reinforced the narrative of her absurd quality control.

### Dedicated (2019)

- **Released:** May 17, 2019
- **Label:** 604 Records / School Boy Records / Interscope
- **Producers:** Jack Antonoff, Captain Cuts, John Hill, Patrik Berger, others
- **Sound:** Slightly more restrained than E·MO·TION but equally sophisticated. More disco and funk influences. Night-driving synth-pop. Jack Antonoff's production brings a different palette — warmer, more analog-feeling, with more space in the arrangements.
- **Key tracks:** "Now That I Found You," "Want You in My Room," "Too Much," "No Drug Like Me," "Julien," "Everything He Needs"
- **Chart:** #17 on Billboard 200.
- **Critical reception:** Strong reviews, with critics noting growth in her songwriting. Some considered it a slight step down from E·MO·TION's peak but acknowledged its consistency and depth.
- **Significance:** Proved E·MO·TION was not a one-off. Solidified her position as a critical darling and live draw.

### Dedicated Side B (2020)

- **Released:** May 21, 2020
- **12 tracks of B-sides from the Dedicated sessions**
- **Key tracks:** "This Love Isn't Crazy," "Solo," "Felt This Way," "Stay Away"
- **Significance:** Again, the B-sides were strong enough to constitute a full album. Released during pandemic lockdowns, giving fans new material when they needed it most.

### The Loneliest Time (2022)

- **Released:** October 21, 2022
- **Label:** 604 Records / School Boy Records / Interscope
- **Producers:** Rostam Batmanglij, John Hill, Tavish Crowe, Danny L Harle, others
- **Sound:** More experimental and varied than previous albums. Disco-pop, space-themed synth-pop, touches of hyperpop, and the title track featuring Rufus Wainwright is a baroque, orchestral duet. Wider dynamic range than E·MO·TION or Dedicated — more quiet moments, more textural variation.
- **Key tracks:** "Western Wind," "Beach House," "Talking to Yourself," "Bends," "The Loneliest Time" (feat. Rufus Wainwright)
- **Chart:** #38 on Billboard 200.
- **Significance:** Showed willingness to push beyond her established sound while maintaining her core emotional sensibility.

### The Loveliest Time (2023)

- **Released:** July 28, 2023
- **13 tracks — companion piece to The Loneliest Time**
- **Sound:** The more experimental, club-leaning B-sides. More electronic textures, hyperpop-adjacent production on some tracks, and a looser, more adventurous feel than the main album.
- **Key tracks:** "After Last Night," "Kamikaze," "Psychedelic Switch," "Aeroplanes"
- **Significance:** Continued her tradition of B-side releases that rival the main albums. More sonically adventurous than previous B-sides collections.

## Musical Analysis — What Makes Carly Rae Jepsen Sound Like Carly Rae Jepsen

### Vocals

Jepsen's voice is her most distinctive instrument — a bright, clear, slightly breathy mid-range soprano that conveys vulnerability and joy simultaneously. She doesn't have the power-belt of an Adele or Beyonce, and that's precisely the point. Her vocal style creates intimacy — she sounds like she's confiding in you, sharing a secret about how she feels. Key characteristics:

- **Breathiness as emotion:** Her breathy quality intensifies during emotional peaks, creating a sense of overwhelm — as if the feeling is too big for her body.
- **Melodic precision:** Despite the breathy, casual-sounding delivery, her pitch and phrasing are exceptionally precise. She knows exactly where to place each note for maximum emotional impact.
- **Vocal stacking:** Heavy use of layered vocal harmonies and doubled vocals, creating a shimmering, chorus-like effect that adds warmth and dimension.
- **The "Carly leap":** A characteristic upward melodic jump in her choruses — her melodies frequently vault upward at key moments, creating a physical sensation of emotional lift-off. "Run Away with Me," "Cut to the Feeling," and "I Really Like You" all feature this.
- **Range:** Comfortable in mid-range; doesn't rely on extreme high notes but uses her upper register strategically for climactic moments.

### Songwriting

Jepsen's songwriting operates on a deceptively simple principle: capture the single most intense moment of a romantic feeling and sustain it for 3-4 minutes. Her lyrics are specific enough to feel personal but universal enough to be anyone's experience. Key patterns:

- **Present-tense urgency:** Most of her songs exist in the eternal now of a feeling — not reflecting on the past but experiencing the emotion in real time.
- **Physical sensation as metaphor:** She writes about emotions as bodily experiences — racing hearts, weak knees, the inability to breathe. This grounds abstract feelings in physical reality.
- **The hook philosophy:** Every section of a Jepsen song contains a hook. Not just the chorus — the verses, pre-choruses, and bridges all carry their own melodic ideas strong enough to be someone else's chorus.
- **Romantic maximalism:** Where many modern pop songwriters favor cynicism or ironic distance, Jepsen commits fully to romantic sincerity. She treats crushes with the intensity others reserve for grand love affairs.

### Production Aesthetic

The E·MO·TION-era production template that defines her sound:

- **Synthesizers as foundation:** Lush, layered synth pads and arpeggiated sequences form the harmonic bed. References 1980s Yamaha DX7 and Roland Juno-106 tones — bright, warm, slightly glassy.
- **Driving rhythms:** Four-on-the-floor kicks or propulsive programmed drums. The rhythmic foundation is always moving forward, creating momentum and urgency.
- **Saxophone and brass:** Strategic use of saxophone (the iconic "Run Away with Me" intro) and brass for dramatic punctuation. Not constant, but when deployed, instantly memorable.
- **Space and dynamics:** Despite the density of arrangement, her best productions maintain breathing room. Elements enter and exit, creating dynamic movement rather than a wall of sound.
- **1980s reference palette:** Gated reverb on snares, chorus effects on guitars, pulsing synth bass, bright digital textures — all filtered through modern production clarity.
- **Disco-pop elements:** Particularly from Dedicated onward, more funk guitar, four-on-the-floor grooves, and string-accented arrangements nod to late-1970s disco.

### The E·MO·TION Effect

What critics call "the E·MO·TION effect" is the album's capacity to make listeners feel the full force of romantic euphoria regardless of their current emotional state. This is achieved through:

- **Key choices:** Predominantly major keys, with strategic minor-key moments for contrast.
- **Tempo range:** Mostly uptempo (115-130 BPM range), maintaining energy without becoming exhausting.
- **Emotional sincerity:** No ironic distance. The songs mean what they say with full intensity.
- **Production maximalism:** Every element is designed to amplify the emotional payload — the synths swell, the drums drive, the hooks soar.

### Influences and Context

Jepsen sits at the intersection of several traditions:

- **1980s synth-pop:** Cyndi Lauper, early Madonna, Tears for Fears, The Human League
- **Swedish pop tradition:** ABBA, Robyn, Max Martin's songwriting school
- **Japanese city pop:** Jepsen has cited 1980s Japanese pop as an influence, and the bright, optimistic synth textures connect directly
- **Phil Spector's Wall of Sound:** Updated for the digital age — layered, dense, emotionally overwhelming production
- **Motown:** The emphasis on melody, hooks, and emotional directness
- **Disco:** Giorgio Moroder's pulsing rhythms, Donna Summer's vocal intensity

## Why Critics Love Her

The critical narrative around Carly Rae Jepsen is one of pop music's most interesting stories of the 2010s:

1. **"Call Me Maybe" paradox:** The song was so omnipresent and seemingly disposable that it initially coded Jepsen as a novelty act — a one-hit wonder. This created a narrative gap: when E·MO·TION turned out to be exceptional, critics felt they had to correct the record, generating disproportionately passionate advocacy.

2. **Pop as art argument:** Jepsen became the test case for pop-critical arguments that pure pop music could be as artistically valid as indie rock or hip-hop. Writing about her became a way to argue for the dignity of pop.

3. **Commercial underperformance as credibility:** E·MO·TION's relative commercial failure (compared to Kiss) paradoxically boosted her critical standing — she wasn't chasing hits, she was making art. The album's cult success through word-of-mouth felt more authentic than chart performance.

4. **The perfectionism narrative:** The "200 songs" story positioned her as a craftsperson of unusual dedication, more akin to a novelist editing drafts than a pop star churning content.

5. **LGBTQ+ community adoption:** Her music was embraced as anthemic within queer communities, adding cultural significance beyond chart positions. "Cut to the Feeling" and "Run Away with Me" became staples at Pride events.

6. **The "your favorite artist's favorite artist" effect:** When other respected musicians (Lorde, Charli XCX, Tegan and Sara) publicly praised her, it validated critical enthusiasm.

Jepsen is known for effervescent, joyful live shows. Her stage presence emphasizes genuine enthusiasm and connection rather than choreography or spectacle. She dances freely, interacts warmly with audiences, and often seems as thrilled by her own songs as the crowd.

- **The Loneliest Time Tour (2023):** Expanded production with more theatrical staging while maintaining her characteristic warmth.
- **Festival appearances:** Regular at major festivals (Coachella, Lollapalooza, Glastonbury). Known for converting skeptics — audiences who come expecting "Call Me Maybe" leave as converts.

Bieber's manager Scooter Braun signed her to School Boy Records/Interscope.

## Reference Tracks (Carly Rae Jepsen Essential Listening)

### Defining the Sound
- **"Run Away with Me"** (E·MO·TION, 2015) — The saxophone intro that launched a thousand essays. Soaring, propulsive synth-pop that critics consider her masterpiece. The "Carly leap" in the chorus is textbook emotional maximalism. If you listen to one CRJ song, make it this one.
- **"Cut to the Feeling"** (E·MO·TION Side B, 2017) — Pure pop euphoria distilled to its essence. Originally a B-side for an animated film, became a cultural touchstone. The chorus is an unrelenting surge of joy. Pride anthem.
- **"Call Me Maybe"** (Kiss, 2012) — The song that changed everything. Beneath the ubiquity is an expertly constructed pop song with an irresistible hook, clever lyrics ("before you came into my life I missed you so bad"), and a vocal performance that makes simplicity sound effortless.
- **"E·MO·TION"** (E·MO·TION, 2015) — Title track that encapsulates the album's thesis: romantic feeling as a force of nature, delivered over gleaming synth-pop production.

### Collaborative Highlights
- **"All That"** (E·MO·TION, 2015) — Dev Hynes collaboration. Warmer, more R&B-inflected than the rest of the album. His production brings a different texture — smoother, more nocturnal. Shows her range beyond pure synth-pop.
- **"Want You in My Room"** (Dedicated, 2019) — Jack Antonoff production. Pulsing, propulsive, with a directness that borders on confrontational. One of her most physically compelling tracks.
- **"The Loneliest Time"** (The Loneliest Time, 2022) — Duet with Rufus Wainwright. Baroque, orchestral, space-themed. Shows her ambition to push beyond the synth-pop template into something grander.
- **"Now That I Found You"** (Dedicated, 2019) — Instantly catchy, perfectly structured pop-disco. The song that proved Dedicated could stand alongside E·MO·TION.

### Deep Cuts & B-Sides
- **"Warm Blood"** (E·MO·TION, 2015) — Rostam Batmanglij collaboration. Art-pop textures, pulsing rhythm, lyrics about physical sensation of attraction. One of E·MO·TION's most adventurous moments.
- **"Boy Problems"** (E·MO·TION, 2015) — Self-aware pop about the ridiculousness of romantic preoccupation. Synth-funk groove. Shows her humor and self-deprecation.
- **"When I Needed You"** (E·MO·TION, 2015) — Ariel Rechtshaid production. Driving, slightly darker than the album's median. Longing channeled into kinetic energy.
- **"Western Wind"** (The Loneliest Time, 2022) — Stripped-back, acoustic-leaning lead single that showed a more contemplative side. Departure from the synth-pop formula.

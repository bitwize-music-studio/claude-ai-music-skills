# Timecop1983 — Deep Dive

## Overview

Timecop1983 is the solo project of Jordy Leenaerts (born August 24, 1983), a Dutch electronic musician from a small town near Eindhoven in the southern Netherlands. He is one of the most beloved and enduring artists in the synthwave genre, frequently called the "undisputed master of Dreamwave" — a softer, more atmospheric, and emotionally driven subgenre of synthwave that he helped define and popularize.

Leenaerts began making music at age 12, experimenting with Scream Tracker on MS-DOS running on a 386 computer, with no formal musical background. Over years of self-teaching, he explored genres ranging from hard rock to classical before the 2011 film *Drive* — specifically its synthwave-infused soundtrack featuring Kavinsky and College — inspired him to focus on 1980s-inspired electronic music. He adopted the moniker Timecop1983, combining a nod to the band Futurecop! with his birth year.

Where peers like Carpenter Brut and Perturbator channel synthwave's aggressive, dystopian potential, and artists like Kavinsky and Lazerhawk define its high-energy outrun side, Timecop1983 carved out space for something softer and more intimate. His music is romantic, cinematic, and melancholic — built on warm synthesizer pads, arpeggiated patterns, reverb-heavy melodies, and dreamy atmospheres that evoke nostalgia for an idealized 1980s that may never have existed but somehow feels real. He has described his own music as "Dreamwave" and consistently centers it on themes of nostalgia, romance, longing, and memory.

Timecop1983 is entirely self-produced. Leenaerts handles all instrumentation and composition, bringing in collaborating vocalists to write lyrics and record vocals with total creative freedom. The project has no permanent singers, though several — particularly Josh Dally, Dana Jean Phoenix, Femmepop, and SEAWAVES — have become recurring collaborators. He gained international recognition around 2016 through the NewRetroWave label, and has since completed four US headline tours, performed at Amsterdam Dance Event, and played shows in Dubai. Multiple albums have charted on the Billboard Top 100 Electronic Music charts, all while remaining entirely independent. He currently averages approximately 325,000 monthly listeners on Spotify.

His music has been placed in major media productions including DC's *Legends of Tomorrow*, Netflix's *Lucifer*, the film *Stream* (from the producers of the Terrifier trilogy), and various short films and video game soundtracks. Timecop1983 is frequently grouped with FM-84 and The Midnight as part of "the holy trinity" of melodic/dreamwave synthwave.

## Musical Style & Production

### Sound & Aesthetic

Timecop1983's sound occupies the dreamy, romantic end of the synthwave spectrum. Key characteristics include:

- **Warm, lush synthesizer pads** — Reverb-heavy, layered synth textures that create vast atmospheric spaces. The pads breathe and swell, generating a cocoon-like warmth that distinguishes his work from the angular, aggressive tones of darksynth
- **Arpeggiated melodic patterns** — Flowing, cyclical synth arpeggios that form the rhythmic and melodic backbone of most tracks. Smooth and undulating rather than sharp or staccato
- **Soft, understated percussion** — Drum machine patterns that sit back in the mix rather than driving aggressively forward. Snares tend toward gated reverb, kicks are pillowy, hi-hats shimmer rather than cut
- **Deep, warm basslines** — Analog-style bass synths that pulse underneath the melodic layers, providing low-end warmth without aggression
- **Cinematic atmosphere** — Heavy use of delay and reverb to create a dreamlike, immersive sonic space. Tracks feel wide, spacious, and enveloping
- **Melodic leads** — Synth lead lines that are smooth and singing, often layered to create rich harmonic textures. Melodies tend to be memorable and emotionally direct without being simplistic
- **Nostalgic but modern** — The production references 1980s techniques and tones but is polished with modern tools, avoiding lo-fi degradation in favor of a warm, clean clarity

### Themes & Emotional Core

- **Nostalgia** — The dominant throughline across his entire catalog. His early work (*Childhood Memories*, *Journeys*) explicitly evokes 1980s and 1990s childhood innocence. Later work broadens to a more universal, bittersweet longing for times past
- **Romance and longing** — Love, heartbreak, regret, and desire run through nearly every vocal track. *Faded Touch* (2021) is his most emotionally raw album, dealing directly with themes of failing relationships, loneliness, and moving on
- **Memory and time** — Track titles and album concepts consistently return to the passage of time: "Childhood Memories," "Flashbacks," "Moments in Time," "Distant Memories," "Timelapse," "Before the Lights Went Out"
- **Nocturnal urban landscapes** — Night drives, city lights, neon-soaked cityscapes. The music evokes a solitary figure driving through an empty city at 2 AM, lost in thought
- **Introspective escapism** — Later work shifts toward futuristic escapism and resilience, blending nostalgia with hope and endurance

### DAW & Production Philosophy

Leenaerts produces entirely in **FL Studio** (Image-Line), having settled on it after years of working with various software and hardware sequencers. He has pushed back against criticism of FL Studio as unprofessional, stating: "It's the cook, not the kitchen." He works from a custom FL Studio template that includes a multiband compressor, parametric EQ, and limiter as the foundation of his mixing approach. Sonic Academy released a dedicated production course — "How to Make Synthwave/Retrowave with Timecop1983 in FL Studio" — covering his synthesis, arrangement, drum programming, bass processing, and mastering techniques.

### Hardware Synthesizers

Leenaerts uses an extensive collection of both vintage and modern hardware:

| Synthesizer | Role | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| **Roland Juno-106** | Pads, leads, everything | Cornerstone of his sound; the synth where "every setting sounds fantastic" |
| **Roland Alpha Juno** | Pads, textures | Complements the 106 |
| **Roland D-50** | Pads, textures | Digital/analog hybrid adding sparkle |
| **Korg MS-20** | Bass, leads | His first mono synth; "I use it a lot... the filter sounds crazy good" |
| **Korg DW-8000** | Signature textures | Highlighted as key to his sound |
| **Korg Prologue 16** | Pads, polyphonic textures | Modern analog |
| **Korg Radias KB** | Sound design | Digital modeling synth |
| **Sequential OB-6** | Warm analog pads | Premium analog poly |
| **Yamaha AN1x** | Leads, pads | Virtual analog from the late 1990s |
| **Alesis Micron** | Various | Compact virtual analog |
| **Moog Voyager** | Bass, leads | Reported in earlier interviews |
| **Roland Boutique JP-08** | Jupiter-8 tones | Compact recreation |

### Software & VSTs

For those recreating his sound without hardware, free plugins commonly associated with his tones include **Synth1**, **OBXD**, and **TAL U-NO-62** (based on the Roland Juno architecture). **TAL U-NO-LX** is the premium Juno emulation frequently cited as the software starting point for Timecop1983-style sounds.

### Evolution Over Time

Timecop1983's sound has evolved meaningfully across his catalog:

- **2014 (Childhood Memories, Journeys)** — Predominantly instrumental dreamwave. Occasional vocal features (Femmepop, Dana Jean Phoenix, Per Rinaldo) but the focus is on synth-driven atmosphere and melodic hooks. Sound is pure nostalgic dreamwave
- **2015 (Reflections)** — Expanded vocal palette with multiple collaborators (Trevor Something, Ollie Wride, Josh Dally, Back In The Future). Still dream-focused but more diverse in vocal approaches
- **2016-2017 (Lovers Pt. 1 & 2)** — EP format exploring romance and heartbreak. SEAWAVES collaborations add ethereal female vocals. Thematic focus narrows to love and loss
- **2018 (Night Drive)** — The breakthrough. Most collaborative album with high-profile features (The Midnight, LeBrock, The Bad Dreamers, Kinnie Lane, Josh Dally). Sound is bigger, more polished, and more confidently cinematic. Considered a genre-defining synthwave album
- **2021 (Faded Touch)** — Josh Dally becomes the primary vocal collaborator (5 of 11 tracks). Emotionally the most raw and vulnerable album, dealing with heartbreak and loneliness — written during COVID lockdown isolation
- **2023 (Searching for Tomorrow)** — Slightly darker tone while retaining dreamwave core. Introspection and resilience themes. Continued Josh Dally partnership. Mastered by Tonebox

## Genre Context: Dreamwave & the Synthwave Spectrum

Synthwave is not monolithic. It spans a wide spectrum from aggressive, industrial-influenced darksynth to soft, atmospheric dreamwave. Understanding where Timecop1983 sits requires understanding the full landscape:

### The Synthwave Spectrum

```
AGGRESSIVE ←――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――→ DREAMY

Perturbator    Carpenter Brut    Kavinsky    Gunship    The Midnight    FM-84    Timecop1983
  Gost        Dance w/ Dead    Lazerhawk   Power Glove  LeBrock     Ollie Wride  Com Truise
Dan Terminus   Magic Sword    Miami Nights                                      Betamaxx

← Darksynth →  ← Outrun →              ← Vocal Synthwave →    ← Dreamwave →
```

### Dreamwave Defined

Dreamwave is the softer, more atmospheric underbelly of synthwave. Key characteristics:

- **Slower tempos** (80-100 BPM vs outrun's 100-120 BPM)
- **Ethereal synths** and reverb-heavy production
- **Emotional depth** prioritized over rhythmic drive
- **Dream pop influence** — lush melodies, gentle vocals, ambient textures
- **Nostalgia as emotion** rather than nostalgia as aesthetic
- Crossover appeal with **chillwave**, **indie**, and **ambient** electronic music

The subgenre traces its roots to the collaboration between Electric Youth and College on "A Real Hero" from the *Drive* soundtrack (2011), widely considered the most famous dreamwave track. Key dreamwave releases include Electric Youth's *Innerworld* (2014), Trevor Something's *Synthetic Love* (2014), and Timecop1983's *Journeys* (2014).

### The "Holy Trinity" of Melodic Synthwave

Timecop1983 is consistently grouped with **FM-84** and **The Midnight** as the three most important artists in melodic/dreamwave synthwave:

- **FM-84** (Col Bennett) — Lush, cinematic vocal synthwave. *Atlas* (2016) featuring Ollie Wride's soaring tenor is the genre's pop crossover masterwork. More polished and vocally-driven than Timecop1983, less prolific
- **The Midnight** (Tyler Lyle & Tim McEwan) — Saxophone-driven vocal synthwave with earnest lyrics. More song-oriented and mainstream-accessible. Active touring schedule. Occupy the middle ground between pop and synthwave
- **Timecop1983** — The most purely atmospheric and melancholic of the three. More instrumental, more introspective, more committed to dreamy textures over pop hooks. The deepest into dreamwave territory

Leenaerts has cited both FM-84 and The Midnight as inspirations, along with Electric Youth and Johnny Jewel (Chromatics/Glass Candy/Symmetry). The *Ex Machina* soundtrack is another acknowledged influence.

### vs. Darksynth

The contrast with darksynth artists is instructive for understanding Timecop1983's position:

| Aspect | Timecop1983 (Dreamwave) | Perturbator/Carpenter Brut (Darksynth) |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Mood** | Romantic, melancholic, nostalgic | Aggressive, dystopian, menacing |
| **Tempo** | 80-100 BPM | 100-140+ BPM |
| **Synth tone** | Warm pads, soft leads | Distorted, screaming, industrial |
| **Drums** | Soft, atmospheric | Punchy, driving, sometimes blast beats |
| **Themes** | Love, memory, longing | Violence, cyberpunk, horror |
| **Influences** | Dream pop, new wave, film romance | Industrial, metal, horror scores |
| **Visual aesthetic** | Sunset, neon, palm trees, VHS | Skulls, demons, neon gore, dystopia |
| **Film parallels** | *Drive* (romance), *Blade Runner* (melancholy) | *Terminator*, *Escape from New York* |

## Reference Tracks

### Essential Timecop1983

- **"Dreams" (feat. Dana Jean Phoenix)** — From *Journeys* (2014). One of his most recognized tracks. Dana Jean Phoenix's vocals float over crystalline arpeggios and warm pads. The track captures everything that makes Timecop1983 special: yearning, warmth, nocturnal atmosphere, and a melody that lodges permanently in the listener's memory. The definitive Timecop1983 vocal track from the early period

- **"On the Run"** — From *Night Drive* (2018). An instrumental that demonstrates Timecop1983 at his most cinematic. Pulsing arpeggios and soaring leads create a sense of urgent forward motion — but romantic urgency, not action-movie urgency. The title track's spiritual twin, perfectly capturing the feeling of driving alone at night with too many feelings

- **"Cruise"** — From *Night Drive* (2018). Pure dreamwave instrumentalism. Smooth, flowing synth lines that feel effortless. The kind of track that makes the listener forget they're hearing synthesizers — it just feels like emotion translated directly into sound waves

- **"Neon Lights" (feat. Josh Dally)** — From *Night Drive* (2018). The Josh Dally partnership at its peak. Dally's earnest vocal delivery against Timecop1983's lush production creates vocal synthwave that's both intimate and expansive. One of the most-played tracks in the catalog

- **"Static" (feat. The Midnight)** — From *Night Drive* (2018). A collaboration between two titans of melodic synthwave. The Midnight's contribution adds a different vocal texture to Timecop1983's dreamwave foundation, demonstrating how his production style adapts to different vocal approaches

- **"Tokyo" (feat. Kinnie Lane)** — From *Night Drive* (2018). Atmospheric and cinematic, with Kinnie Lane's vocals adding an exotic dimension. Evokes the neon-lit nightscapes of the title city — Timecop1983's sonic worlds don't just reference the 1980s, they build entire imagined places

- **"Back to You" (feat. The Bad Dreamers)** — From *Night Drive* (2018). Synthpop-leaning vocal track with an infectious chorus. Demonstrates Timecop1983's ability to craft pop-accessible hooks within dreamwave production

- **"My Delorean" (feat. Primo)** — A fan-favorite single and one of the most instantly recognizable tracks in the catalog. The Back to the Future reference in the title anchors the track in 1980s nostalgia while the music transcends mere pastiche

- **"Lovers" (feat. SEAWAVES)** — From *Lovers Pt. 1* (2016). Ethereal female vocals from the Manchester duo over aching, romantic production. Probably the track that most fully embodies the "romantic synthwave" descriptor

- **"Falling" (feat. Josh Dally)** — From *Faded Touch* (2021). Emotionally raw, written during COVID isolation. The vulnerability in both the production and vocal performance makes this one of Timecop1983's most affecting tracks

- **"Girl" (feat. SEAWAVES)** — From *Lovers Pt. 2* (2017). The track that was placed in DC's Legends of Tomorrow. Dreamy and timeless — the music supervisor specifically noted that it escapes easy time-period classification, which is exactly what Timecop1983's best work achieves

### Deep Cuts & Instrumentals

- **"Nightfall"** — *Night Drive* (2018). Pure atmospheric instrumental
- **"Summer Heat"** — *Journeys* (2014). Captures the warmth and wistfulness of the title perfectly
- **"Flashbacks"** — *Journeys* (2014). Melancholic, reflective instrumental
- **"Tears in the Rain"** — *Lovers Pt. 1* (2016). The Blade Runner reference is earned — this track matches the film's melancholic grandeur
- **"Alone"** — *Faded Touch* (2021). The album's emotional centerpiece — nearly five minutes of solitary reflection
- **"Deckards Dream"** — *Searching for Tomorrow* (2023). Another Blade Runner nod; the album closer blends nostalgia with something darker
- **"Dark Days"** — *Searching for Tomorrow* (2023). Represents the slightly darker tonal shift of the latest album

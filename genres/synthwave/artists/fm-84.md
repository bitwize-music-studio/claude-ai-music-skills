# FM-84 — Deep Dive

## Overview

FM-84 is the synthwave/retrowave project of Col Bennett (born Colin Bennett, 1979), a Scottish musician, producer, and graphic designer originally from Ayrshire, Scotland. After relocating to San Francisco, California, Bennett found creative inspiration in the sun-drenched West Coast aesthetic — golden beaches, palm trees, and the California sunset — channeling that imagery into lush, emotionally resonant electronic music steeped in 1980s nostalgia.

**Genre positioning:** Synthwave, retrowave, dreamwave, vocal synthwave, synth-pop. FM-84 occupies a distinct space within synthwave: where many artists in the scene lean toward instrumental, driving outrun or aggressive darksynth, FM-84 prioritizes heartfelt vocal songwriting, cinematic production, and romantic pop sensibility. The project bridges 1980s AOR (album-oriented rock) with modern synthwave production, creating music that could have charted in 1985 but sounds unmistakably contemporary.

**Scene context:** FM-84 emerged in 2015 during synthwave's golden era of expansion, when the genre was growing beyond its early outrun and darksynth roots into more vocal, pop-accessible territory. Alongside The Midnight and Timecop1983, FM-84 helped define what is sometimes called "popwave" or "vocal synthwave" — the branch of the genre that emphasizes traditional song structures, singable melodies, and emotional depth over pure instrumental atmosphere. These three acts are frequently cited as the genre's essential vocal trinity.

**The name:** FM-84 evokes 1980s FM radio — the dial tuned to a station playing synth-pop deep cuts, the kind of music that soundtracked coming-of-age films and late-night drives. The "84" anchors it firmly in the mid-1980s aesthetic peak.

**Approach:** Bennett is a perfectionist who waited years before releasing any music. He described FM-84 as "a blend of 80s inspired synth pop with layers of soaring sun-soaked cinematic vibes," calling it "the sound of a summer long gone" — a labor of love wrapping together all of his influences from the 1980s through mid-1990s electronica. This patient, quality-over-quantity approach has defined the project: FM-84's discography is small but deeply beloved.

## Members & Collaborators

### Col Bennett — Producer, Songwriter, Multi-instrumentalist (2014–present)

- **Full name:** Colin Bennett
- **Born:** 1979, Ayrshire, Scotland
- **Based:** Currently back in Scotland (returned from San Francisco circa 2021-2022)
- **Background:** Graphic designer by trade. Had been making music as a hobby for years before launching FM-84 but hadn't released anything publicly. The move to California was the catalyst.
- **Early influences:** Grew up in the 1980s on a diet of cinema (The Goonies, Back to the Future, Flight of the Navigator) and his parents' record collection: Fleetwood Mac, Tangerine Dream, Jan Hammer, and Tears for Fears. In the 1990s, he was heavily into progressive house and electronica, citing Sasha, John Digweed, and Dave Seaman as key influences.
- **Role:** Everything. Bennett writes, produces, engineers, and mixes all FM-84 material. He is the sole creative force behind the project's sonic identity.

#### Production Setup

- **DAW:** Ableton Live
- **Approach:** Completely in-the-box (ITB). All software synthesizers and plugins — no hardware synths in the current setup.
- **Former hardware:** Used to own significant hardware, including a mint-condition Roland Juno-60, but sold everything to go fully software. The fact that Atlas was produced entirely with soft synths surprised many in the production community given its authentic retro character.
- **Drums:** Combination of samples and synthesized drums from Waldorf Attack (a retro-style drum synth plugin).
- **Sound design community:** Bennett has close relationships with sound designers in the synth community, collaborating with preset creators and contributing demos for new soundsets.

---

### Ollie Wride — Vocalist, Co-songwriter (2016–present)

- **Full name:** Oliver "Ollie" Jack Wride
- **Born:** November 30, 1989, East Riding of Yorkshire, England
- **Education:** Pocklington School (1997-2006), then Brighton Institute of Music (BIMM) where he earned a degree in Professional Musicianship (2009).
- **Early career:** Got his first break while at BIMM when he auditioned for a band and was subsequently signed by Atlantic Records. Prior to synthwave, Wride had a background in mainstream pop/rock.
- **Entry into synthwave:** In 2015, Wride was introduced by Josh Dally to Timecop1983, collaborating on the track "Wild Love" for the album Reflections. This connection led to the FM-84 collaboration.
- **FM-84 work:** Co-wrote and performed vocals on "Running in the Night," "Wild Ones," and "Don't Want to Change Your Mind" for Atlas (2016), plus post-album singles "Never Stop" (2017) and "Bend & Break" (2019).
- **Vocal style:** Soaring, emotionally rich tenor with a distinctly 1980s quality — comparisons to Don Henley, Bryan Adams, and Phil Collins-era pop vocalists are common. Wride's voice has a lustrous, warm quality that pairs perfectly with Bennett's lush synth production.
- **Musical influences:** David Bowie, Bryan Ferry and Roxy Music, Peter Gabriel, Queen, Michael McDonald — derived from his father's record collection.
- **Live touring:** Toured with FM-84 for sold-out US and Canada shows in 2018, and a fourteen-date US, Canada, and UK tour in 2019.
- **Solo career:** Released debut album Thanks in Advance (2019), co-produced by Michael Oakley, which charted at #95 on the UK Official Album Downloads Chart, hit Billboard's Top 10 Electronic charts, and reached #1 on iTunes Electronic charts. Described as a collection of "MTV-friendly pop, synth rock and colourful ballads." Second album The Pressure Point released February 7, 2025, with single "Wish You Well" featured on Spotify's New Music Friday and John Mayer's SiriusXM Fresh Finds.

### Other Collaborators

| Collaborator | Role | Track(s) |
|-------------|------|----------|
| **Clive Farrington** | Vocals | "Goodbye" (Atlas, 2016) |
| **Timecop1983** | Co-writer, production | "Let's Talk" (Atlas, 2016) |
| **Josh Dally** | Vocals, lyrics | "Let's Talk" (Atlas, 2016) |

**Clive Farrington** is the original founder and lead singer of When in Rome, the British synth-pop band known for the 1988 hit "The Promise." His appearance on Atlas's closing track was a meaningful full-circle moment — an actual 1980s synth-pop artist contributing to a record paying tribute to that era. The collaboration predated Atlas; Bennett and Farrington wrote a track together that was picked up by Cafe Del Mar for their XXII compilation.

**Timecop1983** (Jordy Leenaerts) is a fellow synthwave pillar from the Netherlands. His co-writing credit on "Let's Talk" represents a collaboration between two of the genre's most respected names.

## Discography

### Los Angeles EP (2015)

- **Released:** March 10, 2015
- **Format:** EP (4 core tracks; 7 tracks on Bandcamp with bonus material)
- **Label:** Self-released
- **Producer:** Col Bennett

**Tracklist (Bandcamp version):**
1. DeLorean
2. Nightdrive
3. Outatime
4. Los Angeles
5. Mainframe
6. Neon Sunrise
7. Max (Bonus Track)

**Notes:** FM-84's debut release, entirely instrumental. The titles alone paint the project's aesthetic: DeLorean (Back to the Future), Outatime (the DeLorean's license plate), Nightdrive, Neon Sunrise.

**Critical reception:** Universally acclaimed within the synthwave community and beyond.

- **NewRetroWave:** "Atlas is a profound masterpiece of an album done with an almost unfathomable attention to detail... a breezy, brazen, cinematic journey of mere 46 minutes, but filled to the brim with genuine heart, soul and some unmatchable synth wielding chops."
- **Vehlinggo:** Noted the album aims higher than the Los Angeles EP — Bennett took risks, dabbling in more modern electronic genres while delving deeper into 80s nostalgia, tipping the scale toward romantic pop cuts.
- **Gearspace (formerly Gearslutz):** Users called it "the new retrowave gold standard" and "the first retrowave album that could actually hold its own on the 80s charts," with vocal production "through the roof and totally true to form."
- **Rate Your Music:** "The best synthwave album that I have ever listened to" — praised for layering, instrumentation, and production.

**Production notes:** The album was produced entirely in Ableton Live with software synths. Multiple reviewers were stunned that no hardware synthesizers were used, given the authenticity of the analog-sounding production. Bennett balanced six instrumental tracks with five vocal features, creating an album that flows between introspective synth journeys and soaring pop moments.

**Touring:** Atlas's independent success led to FM-84's first live shows — a sold-out US and Canada tour in 2018, a fourteen-date US/Canada/UK tour in 2019, and a double-bill with The Midnight at The Globe in Los Angeles (November 2017). Bennett also DJed at a Ready Player One event at SXSW in March 2018.

### Never Stop (2017)

- **Released:** August 18, 2017
- **Format:** Single
- **Featured artist:** Ollie Wride (vocals, lyrics)
- **Written by:** Col Bennett and Ollie Wride
- **Produced, engineered, and mixed by:** Col Bennett

**Notes:** First post-Atlas release. Continued the Bennett-Wride partnership with another polished vocal synthwave track. Maintained the Atlas-era sound while hinting at evolution.

---

### Bend & Break (2019)

- **Released:** 2019
- **Format:** Single
- **Featured artist:** Ollie Wride
- **Notes:** Released during the touring era. Another vocal collaboration maintaining the FM-84 formula.

---

### Maverick (Atlas B-Sides) EP (2020)

- **Released:** September 22, 2020
- **Format:** EP (4 tracks, ~17 minutes)
- **Label:** Self-released
- **Producer:** Col Bennett

**Tracklist:**
| # | Title | Duration | Notes |
|---|-------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Maverick | 3:35 | Love letter to Top Gun, Harold Faltermeyer, and Steve Stevens; guitar solo by Ryan Leslie; written 2016-2017 for an unfinished post-Atlas EP |
| 2 | Atlas (Original) | 4:35 | Full version of "Atlas (Interlude)"; written New Year's Eve 2015; didn't fit album vibe, was cut to interlude |
| 3 | Fade (Running in the Night) | 5:00 | The instrumental track that later became "Running in the Night"; written February 2016 |
| 4 | Breathe (2011 Demo) | 4:45 | Written in 2011, before FM-84 existed; love letter to Tangerine Dream and Ulrich Schnauss; written just before the move from Scotland to California |

**Notes:** A retrospective release, quietly dropped in late September 2020. The EP offers a fascinating behind-the-scenes look at the Atlas creation process. "Fade (Running in the Night)" is particularly revealing — hearing the instrumental skeleton that would become FM-84's biggest track demonstrates how Ollie Wride's vocals transformed a good instrumental into a genre-defining song. "Breathe (2011 Demo)" is the oldest FM-84-adjacent recording, predating the project by several years and revealing Bennett's Tangerine Dream and Ulrich Schnauss influences.

---

### Chapter 2 (Upcoming — April 25, 2026)

- **Announced:** Teased across FM-84's social media (Instagram, X/Twitter)
- **Release date:** April 25, 2026 — exactly 10 years after Atlas's release
- **Background:** After the 2019 tour, Bennett relocated back to Scotland with his family (announced December 2021). He cited the move as a chance to focus exclusively on FM-84, along with film and TV scoring and "an exciting side project."

**Status:** The long-awaited second album. The 10-year gap between Atlas and Chapter 2 mirrors Bennett's perfectionist approach — the same patient quality-over-quantity philosophy that defined the project from the beginning.

## Musical Analysis — What Makes FM-84 Sound Like FM-84

### The Synths

FM-84's synth palette is lush, layered, and warm. Despite being entirely software-based, the production achieves a convincing analog character through careful sound design and processing:

- **Pads:** Wide, shimmering synth pads create the "golden light" atmosphere that defines the FM-84 sound. These are often sidechained to create a subtle pumping effect — a modern production technique applied to retro textures.
- **Arpeggios:** Bright, fast arpeggiated synth patterns are an FM-84 signature — crystalline cascades of notes that evoke both 1980s synth-pop and the sparkle of California sunlight. Bennett's arpeggio work on tracks like "Running in the Night" and "Everything" is distinctive and immediately recognizable.
- **Bass:** Deep, warm synth bass provides the foundation. Not the aggressive, distorted bass of darksynth, but a round, full-bodied low end that anchors the dreamy upper layers.
- **Leads:** Soaring synth leads with generous reverb and delay, creating a sense of vastness and yearning. These leads often carry the melodic hook in instrumental sections.

### The Drums

Gated reverb drums are central to the FM-84 sound — that explosive, punchy 1980s snare that defined records by Phil Collins, Peter Gabriel, and Genesis. Bennett achieves this through a combination of samples and the Waldorf Attack drum synth, creating drum patterns that sound authentically 1980s while maintaining modern clarity and punch. The kick-snare patterns are typically straightforward and driving, providing rhythmic momentum without complexity.

### The Vocals

When present, vocals elevate FM-84 from atmospheric synthwave into genuine pop songwriting:

- **Ollie Wride's contribution** is essential to FM-84's most celebrated tracks. His soaring tenor has an earnest, emotional quality that recalls 1980s AOR vocalists — Don Henley, Bryan Adams, Phil Collins — without feeling like pastiche. The vocal production is polished and reverb-rich, sitting within the synth layers rather than on top of them.
- **Vocal tracks vs. instrumentals:** Atlas demonstrates Bennett's skill at balancing both. The vocal tracks (Running in the Night, Wild Ones, Don't Want to Change Your Mind, Let's Talk, Goodbye) are the album's high points by most listeners' assessment, but the instrumentals provide essential pacing and atmosphere.

### The Atmosphere

FM-84's defining quality is mood. The production evokes:

- **California golden hour** — warm, amber-tinted sonic landscapes
- **VHS-era nostalgia** — the hazy, slightly soft quality of memories filtered through time
- **1980s cinema** — the optimistic, aspirational feeling of coming-of-age films
- **Romantic yearning** — a bittersweet quality of looking back at something beautiful that has passed

This atmosphere is created through production choices: generous reverb on everything, warm saturation, careful EQ that rolls off harsh frequencies while boosting warmth, and layered synths that create a sense of depth and space.

### How FM-84 Fits in the Synthwave Landscape

| Dimension | FM-84's Position | Contrast |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| **Aggression** | Soft, warm, romantic | vs. Perturbator/Carpenter Brut (aggressive, dark) |
| **Vocals** | Central to best work | vs. Kavinsky/Lazerhawk (primarily instrumental) |
| **Tempo** | Mid-tempo, driving but not frantic | vs. Outrun artists (faster, more urgent) |
| **Mood** | Nostalgic optimism, bittersweet | vs. Darksynth (dystopian, menacing) |
| **Production** | Polished, radio-ready | vs. Com Truise (lo-fi, warped, experimental) |
| **Songwriting** | Pop-structured, hook-driven | vs. Spacewave artists (ambient, formless) |

FM-84 is closest in spirit to The Midnight and Timecop1983. All three prioritize emotional resonance and songwriting over pure genre exercise. But where The Midnight leans into saxophone and more overt 80s pop pastiche, and Timecop1983 tends toward more minimal, melancholic dreamwave, FM-84 occupies a middle ground — lush and cinematic, with pop hooks that feel organic rather than calculated.

---

## Genre Context — The Vocal Synthwave Scene

### The Trinity

FM-84, The Midnight, and Timecop1983 are frequently cited as the three defining acts of vocal/melodic synthwave:

| Artist | Sound | Signature Element |
|--------|-------|-------------------|
| **FM-84** | Lush, cinematic, California sun-drenched | Ollie Wride's vocals, warm arpeggios |
| **The Midnight** | Saxophone-driven, romantic, narrative | Tyler Lyle's songwriting, sax hooks |
| **Timecop1983** | Minimal, melancholic, intimate | Nostalgic dreamwave, guest vocalists |

### Broader Scene Positioning

| Artist | Relationship to FM-84 |
|--------|----------------------|
| **Kavinsky** | Pioneer; FM-84 inherited the genre Kavinsky helped define but took it in a warmer, more vocal direction |
| **Gunship** | Fellow vocal synthwave; Gunship leans more toward rock production and aggressive energy |
| **The Midnight** | Closest peer; both emphasize emotion and pop songwriting, but The Midnight is more prolific and saxophone-driven |
| **Timecop1983** | Direct collaborator (Atlas); shares dreamwave sensibility but Timecop is more minimal and melancholic |
| **Com Truise** | Both classified as dreamwave, but Com Truise is far more experimental and IDM-adjacent |
| **Perturbator** | Opposite end of the synthwave spectrum — aggressive darksynth vs. FM-84's warm romanticism |
| **Carpenter Brut** | Same contrast as Perturbator — metal-influenced intensity vs. pop warmth |
| **Miami Nights 1984** | Fellow melodic retrowave, but more instrumental and outrun-focused |
| **Michael Oakley** | Connected through Ollie Wride (co-produced Wride's solo debut); similar vocal synthwave territory |
| **Dana Jean Phoenix** | Fellow vocal synthwave; brings a female vocal perspective to a similar sonic palette |

### Cultural Crossover

FM-84's appeal extends beyond the core synthwave community:

- **Synth Riders VR:** "Running in the Night" was featured as DLC in the VR rhythm game Synth Riders, bringing the track to a gaming audience.
- **Anjunabeats:** "Running in the Night" was remixed by Josep & Kane for a Grum-curated Anjunabeats compilation, demonstrating crossover into the broader progressive/melodic electronic world.
- **Cafe Del Mar:** Bennett's collaboration with Clive Farrington appeared on a Cafe Del Mar compilation, connecting FM-84 to the chillout/Balearic scene.

## Reference Tracks

### Essential FM-84

- **"Running in the Night" (feat. Ollie Wride)** — FM-84's signature track and one of synthwave's most recognizable songs. Sparkling arpeggios, driving rhythm, and Wride's soaring vocals combine into what multiple critics call a "massive synthwave hit." The track bridges 1980s AOR and modern synthwave — verse-chorus dynamics that could have charted in 1985. The intro's quintessentially 80s electronic snare and wistful synth tones are instantly recognizable. Has been described as having "an 80s-era Don Henley vibe paired with some on-point hooks and Bennett's trademark bright and fast arpeggiated synth meditations." Featured as DLC in VR game Synth Riders and remixed for an Anjunabeats compilation.

- **"Wild Ones" (feat. Ollie Wride)** — Alongside "Running in the Night," considered one of Atlas's two best tracks. More uptempo and energetic, with an anthemic chorus and driving production. Demonstrates Bennett and Wride's chemistry at its most exuberant.

- **"Don't Want to Change Your Mind" (feat. Ollie Wride)** — The third Wride vocal on Atlas. More introspective and romantic than "Running in the Night" or "Wild Ones," showing the range of the Bennett-Wride partnership.

- **"Everything"** — Atlas's instrumental opener. Sets the album's tone with shimmering synths and a building, cinematic arrangement. Establishes the "golden light of a fading summer sun" atmosphere before any vocals enter.

- **"Jupiter"** — The album's longest instrumental at 5:42. An expansive, atmospheric piece that demonstrates Bennett's ability to create immersive sonic worlds without vocals.

- **"Goodbye" (feat. Clive Farrington)** — Atlas's closing track featuring When in Rome's original lead singer. A poignant full-circle moment — an actual 1980s synth-pop vocalist contributing to a modern tribute to that era. Provides emotional closure to the album.

- **"Never Stop" (feat. Ollie Wride)** — Post-Atlas single that continued the winning formula. Polished vocal synthwave with memorable hooks.

### Deep Cuts & B-Sides

- **"Maverick"** — Title track of the B-Sides EP. Bennett's love letter to Top Gun, Harold Faltermeyer, and Steve Stevens. Features Ryan Leslie's guitar solo. Written 2016-2017 for a post-Atlas EP that was never completed.

- **"Fade (Running in the Night)"** — The instrumental version of "Running in the Night" from the Atlas sessions (February 2016). Essential listening for understanding how Wride's vocals transformed an already compelling instrumental into a genre-defining track.

- **"Breathe (2011 Demo)"** — The oldest FM-84-adjacent recording, a love letter to Tangerine Dream and Ulrich Schnauss written before the project existed. Shows Bennett's ambient, spacious side and the roots of the FM-84 sound.

### Los Angeles EP Highlights

- **"DeLorean"** — The debut track. Neon-soaked instrumental that established FM-84's identity from the first notes. Named after the Back to the Future time machine.

- **"Nightdrive"** — Captures the nocturnal, driving-through-Los-Angeles energy that would become an FM-84 hallmark.

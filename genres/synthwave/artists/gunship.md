# GUNSHIP — Deep Dive

## Overview

GUNSHIP (stylised as GUNSHIP) is a British synthwave band formed in 2014 by Dan Haigh and Alex Westaway, later joined by drummer Alex Gingell. All three members attended Rugby School together. Haigh and Westaway were previously bandmates in Fightstar, the post-hardcore band fronted by Charlie Simpson (formerly of Busted). When Fightstar went on hiatus in 2010, Haigh and Westaway channeled their creative energy into what would become GUNSHIP — a project built on their shared obsession with 1980s cinema, video games, and synthesizers.

Between 2012 and 2014, the duo built an online following by sharing demos and remixes on SoundCloud, cultivating interest within the emerging synthwave community before any formal release. Their self-titled debut arrived in 2015, mastered at Abbey Road Studios, and immediately distinguished itself from the synthwave landscape by combining vintage analog synthesizer textures with rock song structures, prominent vocals, and cinematic production values that far exceeded genre norms.

**Genre positioning:** Synthwave, retrowave, cinematic synthwave, vocal synthwave, darkwave. GUNSHIP occupies a unique position within synthwave: they brought rock band sensibilities — verse-chorus dynamics, layered guitar, aggressive energy — to a predominantly instrumental electronic genre. Where most synthwave acts are solo bedroom producers, GUNSHIP functions as a band with distinct creative roles, live drums, and a collaborative approach to production.

**Scene context:** GUNSHIP are credited with helping to popularize the synthwave scene and evolving it by adding rock song structure and extensive use of vocals to a predominantly instrumental genre. They appeared alongside John Carpenter in the 2019 documentary *The Rise of the Synths*, exploring the origins of the synthwave genre. Their debut album is considered one of the first synthwave crossover albums, bridging the gap between underground electronic scenes and mainstream rock audiences.

**Visual identity:** GUNSHIP's visual output is as central to their identity as the music itself. Dan Haigh's background in film direction, VFX, and video game design drives an ambitious visual program — animated music videos, claymation (by Lee Hardcastle), pixel art, and elaborate artwork by James White at Signalnoise. Their production company, Horsie in the Hedge, produces all visual content in-house, collaborating with BAFTA-nominated cinematographers and Emmy award-winning VFX teams. The videos are saturated with 1980s pop culture references — Robocop, Alien, He-Man, The Breakfast Club, The Lost Boys, Ghostbusters — and function as standalone short films.

**Self-description:** Dan Haigh has described GUNSHIP as "a neon soaked, late night, sonic getaway drive, dripping with luscious analog synthesizers, cinematic vocals and cyberpunk values."

## Fightstar Connection

Fightstar were an English post-hardcore/alternative rock band formed in London in 2003. The lineup was Charlie Simpson (lead vocals, guitar), Alex Westaway (co-vocals, guitar), Dan Haigh (bass), and Omar Abidi (drums). Simpson was still a member of pop act Busted when Fightstar formed — he met Westaway and Abidi at a party where they jammed Rage Against the Machine's "Killing in the Name." Westaway later invited his school friend Haigh.

Fightstar released four albums — *Grand Unification* (2006), *One Day Son, This Will All Be Yours* (2007), *Be Human* (2009), and *Behind the Devil's Back* (2015) — blending post-hardcore, alternative metal, and progressive rock. They went on hiatus in 2010 (the catalyst for GUNSHIP's creation) and briefly reunited in 2014–2015. Charlie Simpson has subsequently appeared as a guest on GUNSHIP tracks, including both "Tech Noir" and "Tech Noir 2."

The Fightstar connection matters for understanding GUNSHIP: Haigh and Westaway brought rock-band dynamics, songwriting discipline, and an understanding of how to build dramatic compositions with tension and release — skills honed in a post-hardcore context and applied to synthesizer-driven music.

| 11 | Nuclear Date Night | Feat. Tim Cappello |
| 12 | Run Like Hell | |
| 13 | Lost Shadow | |
| 14 | Postcard From The American Dream | |

**Sound:** The most ambitious and genre-bending GUNSHIP album. Expanded their sonic palette to incorporate elements of techno, metal, ambient, and industrial alongside cinematic synthwave. The guest list reads like a fantasy draft — Dave Lombardo (legendary Slayer drummer), John Carpenter (again), Tyler Bates (film score composer), Gavin Rossdale, Carpenter Brut, HEALTH, and Britta Phillips (the singing voice of Jem from Jem and the Holograms, a perfect 1980s callback).

**Guest features:** The depth and range of collaborators on Unicorn is remarkable. Lombardo's drumming on "Monster In Paradise" brings genuine thrash metal energy. Carpenter Brut and Gavin Rossdale on "Doom Dance" is a darksynth-rock collision. HEALTH on "Blood For The Blood God" pushes into industrial noise territory. Britta Phillips on "Holographic Heart" is an inspired deep-cut 1980s reference. Tim Cappello returns on "Nuclear Date Night." John Carpenter and Charlie Simpson reprise their roles on "Tech Noir 2," closing a creative loop that began with the debut album.

**Significance:** Demonstrated that GUNSHIP's ambition continues to expand with each album. The sheer range of collaborators — from thrash metal to noise rock to 1980s cartoon voice actors — reflects a band that sees synthwave not as a genre limitation but as a launching pad.

## Musical Analysis — What Makes GUNSHIP Sound Like GUNSHIP

### The Synthesizers

GUNSHIP's sound is built on Dan Haigh's extensive collection of genuine vintage analog synthesizers, which gives their music an authentic warmth and depth that purely digital productions struggle to achieve:

- **Roland Juno-106:** Haigh considers this and the Juno-60 as responsible for "a good chunk of '80s synth output." The onboard chorus transforms stabs and pads into what he calls "glowing neon bliss." A cornerstone of the GUNSHIP pad sound.
- **Moog Minimoog / Mother-32 / Little Phatty:** The Moog instruments provide the raw, organic analog bass and lead tones. Haigh describes the Mother-32 as excelling at "relatively simple but incredibly beautiful tones" that sound like "pure real synth."
- **Sequential Prophet-6 & Prophet-12:** Key to GUNSHIP's layered, evolving textures. Haigh has praised the Prophet-12 for overdub sessions.
- **Access Virus TI2:** Despite being digital, used for "complex and evolving atmospheric patches" — the Virus handles the more extreme, otherworldly textures.
- **ARP Odyssey, Roland D-50, Korg Minilogue, Analogue Solutions Leipzig:** Additional texture instruments. The Leipzig handles "detail layers."

The combination of genuine vintage hardware and modern digital tools gives GUNSHIP a sonic depth that is immediately recognizable — warm, thick, and tactile in ways that purely software-based synthwave rarely achieves.

### The Vocals

Alex Westaway's vocals are GUNSHIP's most distinguishing feature within the synthwave landscape. Where most synthwave either eschews vocals entirely or features detached, processed singing, Westaway delivers with genuine rock-singer intensity:

- **Range:** From whispered, atmospheric passages to powerful, emotionally charged belting
- **Rock foundation:** His Fightstar background means he can drive a chorus with urgency and weight
- **Versatility:** Can match the mood of any track — intimate on balladic moments, aggressive on darkwave passages, wistful on nostalgic pieces
- **Production treatment:** Reverb-heavy and processed enough to sit within the synth textures, but present and human enough to cut through — never buried, never clinical

### The Drums

Alex Gingell's drumming bridges electronic and organic:

- Programmed drum machine patterns provide the rhythmic backbone on many tracks
- Live drum overdubs add energy, fills, and dynamics that purely programmed drums lack
- The combination creates a hybrid feel — mechanically tight but humanly expressive
- On heavier tracks, the drums push toward rock intensity; on atmospheric pieces, they recede into electronic pulse

### Guest Features as Compositional Strategy

GUNSHIP's extensive use of guest collaborators is not gimmickry — it's a compositional strategy. Each guest is chosen for what they bring to a specific track:

- **Tim Cappello:** His saxophone is literally the sound of The Lost Boys — casting him on "Dark All Day" makes the 1980s nostalgia concrete and physical
- **John Carpenter:** His narration adds gravitas and direct lineage to the horror-synth tradition
- **Charlie Simpson:** Brings Fightstar energy, connecting GUNSHIP's past to their present
- **Dave Lombardo, HEALTH, Carpenter Brut:** Push individual tracks into aggressive territory the core trio alone might not reach
- **Britta Phillips, Kat Von D, Stella Le Page:** Female vocal textures that contrast with and complement Westaway's delivery

### Cinematic Scope

GUNSHIP compositions think in terms of film scores — scenes, tension, release, atmosphere. Tracks build cinematically rather than following standard pop or electronic structures. This is reinforced by:

- Dan Haigh's film direction and VFX background
- Elaborate music videos that function as short films
- Track titles and themes drawn from 1980s cinema (Tech Noir from The Terminator, When You Grow Up from The Breakfast Club, Art3mis & Parzival from Ready Player One)
- Production that creates spatial depth — foreground, midground, background layers

### Production Values

GUNSHIP's production exceeds typical synthwave standards:

- Mixed by Carl Bown
- Debut mastered at Abbey Road Studios by Geoff Pesche
- Rock-level attention to dynamics, frequency balance, and stereo imaging
- Dense but clear mixes — every synth layer, vocal track, and drum hit has its own space
- Radio-ready compression and polish while maintaining analog warmth

### How GUNSHIP Fits in the Synthwave Landscape

| Dimension | GUNSHIP's Position | Contrast |
|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| **Format** | Band (3 members + guests) | vs. most synthwave (solo producers) |
| **Vocals** | Central, rock-singer delivery | vs. FM-84 (pop tenor), The Midnight (songwriter delivery), Kavinsky (vocoder) |
| **Aggression** | Moderate to high, varies by track | vs. Perturbator/Carpenter Brut (consistently aggressive), FM-84 (consistently soft) |
| **Production** | Rock-level, Abbey Road mastering | vs. bedroom/Bandcamp production norms |
| **Guest features** | Extensive, deliberate | vs. most synthwave (solo or minimal collaboration) |
| **Visual content** | Film-quality music videos | vs. most synthwave (simple or no video) |
| **Hardware** | Genuine vintage analog synths | vs. many peers (software-based) |
| **Song structure** | Rock-influenced verse-chorus | vs. outrun (loop-based), darksynth (build-drop) |

## Visual & Cultural Identity

### Music Videos

GUNSHIP's music videos are a core part of their artistic output, not afterthoughts:

- **"Tech Noir" (2015):** Claymation by Lee Hardcastle. Features John Carpenter voiceover. Cameos by Robocop, Alien, Jason Voorhees, Leatherface, He-Man, and Pinhead. IMDb rating 8.1. Described as "brutal" by metal press.
- **"Revel In Your Time" (2015):** Pixel art animation in 8-bit aesthetic, reflecting cyberpunk influences.
- **"Dark All Day" (2018):** Animated by Enol and Luis Pelayo Junquera. Homage to vampire slayers — Buffy, Blade, Seth Gecko, The Frog Brothers.
- **"When You Grow Up, Your Heart Dies" (2018):** Features fan-submitted recordings and Wil Wheaton.
- **"Tech Noir 2" (2025):** Claymation by Lee Hardcastle (returning). Features John Carpenter, Charlie Simpson, and Tim Cappello.

### Horsie in the Hedge

The band's production company, co-founded by all three members in 2009, handles both their music label (Horsie in the Hedge LLP) and visual production. This vertical integration means GUNSHIP controls every aspect of their output — music, visuals, packaging, and release strategy. They collaborate with high-end film industry talent (BAFTA-nominated DPs, VFX teams from Skyfall) while emphasizing practical effects and prosthetics over CGI.

### Artwork

James White at Signalnoise designed GUNSHIP's iconic visual identity — neon-chrome logos and album designs with a heavy 1980s aesthetic. The visual branding is instantly recognizable and has become synonymous with the synthwave genre itself.

### The Rise of the Synths

In 2019, GUNSHIP appeared in the documentary *The Rise of the Synths*, exploring the origins of the synthwave genre alongside John Carpenter and other key figures. Their inclusion alongside Carpenter cemented their status as central figures in the scene.

---

## Lyrical Themes

### 1980s Nostalgia and Pop Culture

GUNSHIP's lyrics and titles are steeped in 1980s references — not as shallow pastiche but as a genuine emotional engagement with the era's films, TV, games, and cultural artifacts. Track titles reference The Terminator ("Tech Noir"), The Breakfast Club ("When You Grow Up, Your Heart Dies"), Ready Player One ("Art3mis & Parzival"), and Richard K. Morgan's Altered Carbon universe ("Woken Furies").

### Cinematic Narrative

Many tracks function as miniature film scores with lyrical narratives — stories of pursuit, romance, danger, and transformation set in neon-lit dystopias and retrofuturistic landscapes.

### Cyberpunk and Dystopia

Dark technology, surveillance, virtual reality, and human-machine interfaces recur throughout the catalog. "The Drone Racing League," "Cyber City," "The Hegemon," "Blood For The Blood God" — the titles alone trace a cyberpunk worldview.

### Romance and Yearning

Beneath the neon and chrome, GUNSHIP trades in emotional vulnerability — longing for lost innocence, romantic connection in digital wastelands, the tension between nostalgia and forward motion.

---

## Legacy and Influence

**Synthwave crossover pioneers:** GUNSHIP helped legitimize synthwave for audiences coming from rock, metal, and alternative backgrounds. Their band format, rock production values, and emphasis on vocals opened doors that purely electronic acts could not.

**Visual culture elevation:** Their investment in high-quality animated music videos raised the visual standard for the entire synthwave genre.

**Guest feature model:** GUNSHIP's extensive, thoughtful use of guest collaborators — from John Carpenter to Dave Lombardo to Britta Phillips — created a model for how synthwave acts could expand their sonic palette and cultural reach through collaboration.

**Rock press recognition:** Coverage in metal and rock publications (MetalSucks, XPress Magazine) alongside electronic press, demonstrating the cross-genre appeal that GUNSHIP pioneered.

**Independent operation:** Like FM-84 and many synthwave peers, GUNSHIP operate entirely independently through their own label (Horsie in the Hedge), maintaining complete creative control over music, visuals, and release strategy.

## Reference Tracks (GUNSHIP Essential Listening)

### Defining the Sound

- **"Tech Noir"** (GUNSHIP, 2015) — The track that put GUNSHIP on the map. John Carpenter's narration opens over building synths before Charlie Simpson's guest vocals and the band's own performance create a cinematic synthwave epic. The Lee Hardcastle claymation video — packed with 1980s horror/action icons — became a viral sensation. Named after the nightclub in The Terminator. Demonstrates everything that makes GUNSHIP distinctive: guest features with purpose, cinematic scope, rock energy, and visual artistry.

- **"Dark All Day" (feat. Tim Cappello & Indiana)** (Dark All Day, 2018) — Tim Cappello's saxophone — the actual sound of The Lost Boys beach concert — over GUNSHIP's driving synthwave production, with Indiana's vocals adding a second dimension. The animated video homages vampire slayers from Buffy to Blade. This is GUNSHIP at their most accessible and their most referential — a love letter to 1980s vampire cinema made physical through Cappello's presence.

- **"Fly For Your Life"** (GUNSHIP, 2015) — Pure synthwave momentum. One of the debut album's most propulsive tracks, showcasing Westaway's vocal range over Haigh's layered synth production. Demonstrates GUNSHIP's ability to create driving, energetic music without relying on guest features.

- **"When You Grow Up, Your Heart Dies"** (Dark All Day, 2018) — Named after a line from The Breakfast Club. Features fan-submitted recordings led by Wil Wheaton, creating a communal, emotionally resonant experience. Shows GUNSHIP's willingness to experiment with unconventional elements and their connection to the fan community.

### Cinematic Scope

- **"The Drone Racing League"** (Dark All Day, 2018) — Futuristic and propulsive, this instrumental-driven track captures GUNSHIP's cyberpunk side. Later released as a limited edition glow-in-the-dark 7" vinyl with a Power Glove remix. Won a fan remix competition (VHS Glitch).

- **"Woken Furies"** (Dark All Day, 2018) — Named after the Richard K. Morgan cyberpunk novel. Dark, atmospheric album opener that establishes the more aggressive tone of the second album.

### Guest Feature Highlights

- **"Black Blood Red Kiss" (feat. Kat Von D)** (Dark All Day, 2018) — Kat Von D's haunting, gothic vocal adds a seductive darkness. The collaboration extended beyond this track — Dan Haigh later mixed Kat Von D's debut album *Love Made Me Do It* and GUNSHIP remixed her single "Exorcism."

- **"Doom Dance" (feat. Carpenter Brut & Gavin Rossdale)** (Unicorn, 2023) — A collision of synthwave heavyweights and rock royalty. Carpenter Brut's darksynth intensity meets Gavin Rossdale's rock vocals over GUNSHIP's cinematic production. Demonstrates the audacious scope of Unicorn's collaborations.

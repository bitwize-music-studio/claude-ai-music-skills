# Synthwave

## Genre Overview

Synthwave is a retro-futuristic electronic music genre that draws inspiration from 1980s film soundtracks, arcade video games, and synth-pop music. The genre emerged in the mid-2000s from online communities and French house scenes, with early pioneers like Kavinsky, College, and David Grellier (College) crafting nostalgic electronic compositions that evoked neon-lit cityscapes and VHS-era aesthetics. These artists drew heavily from the cinematic scores of John Carpenter, Vangelis, and Tangerine Dream, filtering 1980s production techniques through modern digital tools to create something simultaneously familiar and fresh.

The genre's breakthrough into mainstream consciousness came with the 2011 film Drive, which featured Kavinsky's "Nightcall" and College's "A Real Hero" prominently in its soundtrack. The film's aesthetic—chrome, neon, nocturnal Los Angeles, and brooding antiheroes—became inseparable from synthwave's identity. This exposure catalyzed explosive growth: Bandcamp became flooded with synthwave releases, labels like NewRetroWave and Blood Music emerged as genre tastemakers, and a vibrant visual culture developed around VHS glitches, grid patterns, palm trees, and Lamborghini Countachs. The genre bifurcated into lighter, more melodic retrowave and the heavier, more aggressive darksynth pioneered by Perturbator and Carpenter Brut.

Today, synthwave has matured into a diverse ecosystem with distinct regional scenes and stylistic camps. The genre has influenced mainstream pop production (The Weeknd's "Blinding Lights"), video game soundtracks (Hotline Miami, Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon), and film scores (Thor: Ragnarok, Stranger Things). Modern synthwave artists push boundaries by incorporating live instrumentation, orchestral elements, and vocal-driven songwriting while maintaining the genre's core nostalgia. From the aggressive industrial fusion of Gost to the romantic crooning of The Midnight, synthwave continues to evolve while honoring its 1980s source material, proving that retro-futurism remains a potent creative force in electronic music.

## Characteristics

- **Instrumentation**: Analog and digital synthesizers (Juno-106, Prophet-5, DX7, modern VSTs), drum machines (LinnDrum, TR-707, Oberheim DMX), bass synths, vintage keyboards, occasional guitars, orchestral strings, and vocoder
- **Vocals**: Often processed and atmospheric, ranging from robotic vocoder to breathy human delivery; frequently layered with reverb and delay; many tracks are purely instrumental; when present, vocals tend toward emotional earnestness or detached cool
- **Production**: Heavy use of gated reverb (especially on drums and snare), sidechain compression, analog warmth, tape saturation; polished but organic sound; emphasis on texture over clinical clarity; sidechained pads creating pumping effect
- **Energy/Mood**: Nostalgic yet futuristic, cinematic, dreamlike, introspective; ranges from melancholic and romantic to dark and aggressive; evokes 1980s film noir, cyberpunk dystopia, and neon-soaked nightscapes
- **Structure**: Typically longer track lengths (4-7+ minutes); gradual builds, atmospheric intros, synth-led arrangements; emphasis on hooks and memorable melodic phrases; often features extended instrumental sections and breakdown/climax dynamics
- **Tempo**: Generally 80-118 BPM; outrun tracks tend toward faster tempos (100-120 BPM), dreamwave slower and more relaxed (80-100 BPM), darksynth varies widely

## Lyric Conventions

- **Default rhyme scheme**: XAXA or ABAB — follows 80s pop conventions when vocals present. Often instrumental.
- **Rhyme quality**: Near rhymes acceptable. Nostalgic, retro-futuristic tone.
- **Verse structure**: Verse-chorus when vocals present. Concise verses (4–8 lines), catchy chorus.
- **Key rule**: Themes of technology, futurism, nostalgia, retrofuturism. Combine vintage references with modern ideas. Many tracks are purely instrumental.
- **Avoid**: Lyrics that don't fit the 80s aesthetic. Overly modern references. Excessive lyrics in an instrumental-first genre.
- **Density/pacing (Suno)**: Default **4-6 lines/verse** at 90-120 BPM. Retro aesthetic — clean vocal lines over synth pads. 80s movie soundtrack feel. Topics: 1-2/verse.

## Reference Tracks

- **Kavinsky - "Nightcall"** — The quintessential synthwave anthem that launched a thousand imitators. Featured in Drive (2011), the track combines a pulsing bass line, filtered vocals (by Lovefoxxx of CSS), and vast reverb spaces. Sparse arrangement demonstrates synthwave's "less is more" philosophy: simple elements given room to breathe create maximum impact. The vocoder verses contrasting with breathy human chorus became a genre template.

- **Carpenter Brut - "Turbo Killer"** — Darksynth's defining statement. Aggressive synth stabs, industrial-influenced drums, and horror-film tension build to euphoric release. The accompanying music video by Seth Ickerman became a cult classic, demonstrating synthwave's visual culture. Shows how the genre can incorporate metal intensity while maintaining electronic core.

- **Perturbator - "Perturbator's Theme"** — From Dangerous Days, this track exemplifies darksynth's cyberpunk dystopia aesthetic. Relentless arpeggios, distorted leads, and cinematic breakdowns evoke Blade Runner's neon-noir atmosphere. James Kent's production is dense yet dynamic, proving aggressive synthwave can maintain compositional sophistication.

- **The Midnight - "Sunset"** — Vocal synthwave at its most romantic. Tyler Lyle's earnest vocals over lush pads and saxophone (by Kenny Loggins collaborator Jay Graydon's heir apparent) demonstrate how the genre evolved beyond instrumentals. The track's nostalgia is specific yet universal—longing for summers past, connections lost. Template for emotionally resonant synthwave songwriting.

- **Gunship - "Dark All Day"** — Rock-influenced synthwave featuring Tim Capello's saxophone (the oiled musician from The Lost Boys). Guest vocalists elevate what could be pastiche into genuine artistic statement. Production values exceed typical synthwave—compressed, punchy, radio-ready while maintaining genre identity.

- **Lazerhawk - "Overdrive"** — Pure outrun distilled. Crystalline arpeggios, driving rhythm, and melodic synth leads create momentum without aggression. From Skull and Shark, this track represents synthwave's more accessible, celebratory side—the genre as soundtrack to imaginary sports car drives down Pacific Coast Highway.

- **Com Truise - "Brokendate"** — Dreamwave's warped nostalgia. Seth Haley's detuned synths and wobbly production evoke degraded VHS tapes and half-remembered 1980s childhoods. More experimental than straightforward retrowave, showing synthwave's capacity for IDM-adjacent abstraction while maintaining emotional accessibility.

- **FM-84 - "Running in the Night"** — Features Ollie Wride's soaring tenor over Col Bennett's lush production. The track bridges 1980s AOR (album-oriented rock) and modern synthwave, with verse-chorus dynamics that could have charted in 1985. Demonstrates vocal synthwave's pop crossover potential while maintaining genre authenticity.

- **Gost - "Behemoth"** — Industrial-metal-synthwave fusion. Distorted everything—synths, drums, vocals—creating a wall of sound that owes as much to Nine Inch Nails as to Kavinsky. Shows how far darksynth can push from the genre's origins while remaining recognizably synthwave.

- **Mitch Murder - "Interceptor"** — Film-score-influenced retrowave that sounds like an action movie soundtrack from 1986. Orchestral stabs meet synth arpeggios; builds and releases tension cinematically. Johan Bengtsson's production is cleaner and more playful than darksynth peers, representing synthwave's fun, unpretentious side.

- **Magic Sword - "In The Face of Evil"** — Cinematic synthwave with fantasy-epic scope. Featured in Hotline Miami 2, the track builds from atmospheric intro to triumphant climax with orchestral sensibility. The masked trio's theatrical approach shows synthwave's capacity for world-building and narrative through instrumental music.

- **Timecop1983 - "On the Run"** — Dreamwave's romantic side. From *Night Drive* (2018), this instrumental is bittersweet and nostalgic without darksynth's aggression or outrun's intensity. Jordy Leenaerts crafts intimate synthwave perfect for late-night drives and introspective moments—the genre as emotional processing tool.

- **Power Glove - "Power Core"** — From Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon soundtrack. Video game synthwave that perfectly captures 1980s action-film excess: explosive drums, screaming leads, relentless energy. The track demonstrates synthwave's natural fit for gaming—both mediums trafficking in the same nostalgic visual language.

- **Dance With the Dead - "Andromeda"** — Metal-synthwave hybrid with actual guitar. Justin Pointer and Tony Kim blend heavy riffs with electronic production, creating something that appeals to both synthwave purists and metalheads. Represents the genre's growing incorporation of live instrumentation and rock dynamics.

- **Daniel Deluxe - "Air"** — Atmospheric cyberpunk synthwave from Germany. Blade Runner-influenced sound design, patient builds, and immersive production create sonic worlds rather than simple tracks. Demonstrates European synthwave scene's emphasis on atmosphere and world-building over immediate hooks.

# Funk

## Genre Overview

Funk is a rhythm-driven genre built on syncopated grooves, deep bass lines, and an undeniable emphasis on the "one"—the downbeat that makes you move. Originating from soul, R&B, and jazz, funk strips away melody to focus on pocket-perfect rhythm, horn stabs, and danceable energy. From James Brown's tight machine-like grooves to Parliament-Funkadelic's psychedelic explorations, funk remains the blueprint for modern hip-hop, electronic music, and any genre that prioritizes the groove.

## Characteristics

- **Instrumentation**: Bass guitar, drums, rhythm guitar, horn section, keyboards, synthesizers
- **Vocals**: Soulful, rhythmic, talk-singing, falsetto, often call-and-response
- **Production**: Raw analog grooves to modern synth-heavy textures
- **Energy**: Hypnotic, locked-in groove with emphasis on rhythm over melody
- **Structure**: Built around repeating grooves, horn section punctuation, extended instrumental passages

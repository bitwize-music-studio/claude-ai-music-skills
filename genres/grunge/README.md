# Grunge

## Genre Overview

Grunge emerged from Seattle in the late 1980s as a raw fusion of punk attitude, heavy metal riffs, and indie rock aesthetics. Characterized by distorted guitars, angst-driven vocals, and introspective lyrics, grunge captured a generation's disillusionment while achieving unprecedented mainstream success. The genre emphasizes authenticity, emotional intensity, and a deliberate rejection of polish and artifice.

## Characteristics

- **Instrumentation**: Electric guitar with heavy distortion, bass guitar, drums, occasional acoustic elements
- **Vocals**: Often raw, anguished, or melancholic; range from whispered to powerful
- **Production**: Typically thick, layered distortion; raw studio aesthetic mixed with polished moments
- **Energy**: Alternates between introspective quietness and explosive power; dynamic range is key
- **Structure**: Verse-chorus with quiet-loud dynamics, sudden shifts in intensity, extended instrumental passages
- **Lyrics**: Introspective, dealing with anxiety, alienation, depression, and existential themes

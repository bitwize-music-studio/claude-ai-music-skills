# Jazz

## Genre Overview

Jazz is America's most significant contribution to world music, a living art form built on improvisation, harmonic sophistication, and individual expression within a collective framework. Born in New Orleans around the turn of the 20th century from the convergence of African rhythmic traditions, blues, ragtime, brass band music, and European harmonic concepts, jazz has continuously reinvented itself across more than a century of evolution.

The music emerged from the unique cultural melting pot of New Orleans, where African American musicians blended call-and-response vocals, blue notes, and syncopated rhythms with European instruments and harmony. Early New Orleans jazz featured collective improvisation, with trumpet, clarinet, and trombone weaving melodic lines over a rhythm section. As jazz spread north during the Great Migration, it transformed—the 1920s saw hot jazz and stride piano in New York; the 1930s-40s brought the swing era's big bands to dance halls nationwide; bebop revolutionized the music in the mid-1940s with faster tempos and complex harmony; cool jazz, hard bop, modal jazz, and free jazz followed in the 1950s-60s; and fusion, smooth jazz, and neo-bop continued the evolution into contemporary times.

What unifies all jazz is the centrality of improvisation—the spontaneous creation of melody over chord changes—and swing feel, that elusive rhythmic quality where eighth notes are played with uneven, lilting feel rather than straight. Jazz musicians engage in musical conversation, responding to each other in real time, making every performance unique. The tradition balances individual virtuosity with collective interplay, harmonic complexity with emotional directness, and respect for tradition with restless innovation.

## Characteristics

- **Instrumentation**: Saxophone (alto, tenor, soprano, baritone), trumpet, trombone, piano, upright bass, drums (the classic quintet format); additionally clarinet, vibraphone, guitar, organ, flute, and full big band sections (saxes, trumpets, trombones, rhythm section)
- **Vocals**: Ranges from absent (instrumental jazz) to central; when present, features scatting (improvised syllables), conversational phrasing, behind-the-beat delivery, melodic interpretation of standards, or vocalese (lyrics set to famous solos)
- **Production**: Historically captured in studio with minimal processing to preserve acoustic dynamics and room sound; modern production may include electronic elements while maintaining organic core; emphasis on capturing the interplay between musicians
- **Rhythm**: Swing feel (uneven eighth notes), syncopation, polyrhythm; tempo ranges from slow ballads (40-60 BPM) through medium swing (100-140 BPM) to uptempo bebop (180-300+ BPM); common time signatures include 4/4, 3/4 (jazz waltz), and odd meters like 5/4 and 7/4
- **Harmony**: Sophisticated chord vocabulary including major 7ths, minor 7ths, dominant 7ths, diminished, augmented, and extended chords (9ths, 11ths, 13ths); alterations (b9, #9, #11, b13); chord substitutions (tritone subs, passing diminished); modes (Dorian, Mixolydian, Lydian, Locrian, altered scale); chromatic voice leading and reharmonization; ii-V-I progressions fundamental
- **Structure**: Head-solos-head format (melody statement, improvised solos over chord changes, melody return); 12-bar blues, 32-bar AABA, and through-composed forms; trading fours/eights between soloists and drummer; intros, outros, and vamps
- **Mood**: Ranges from intimate and introspective (ballads, cool jazz) to joyous and swinging (bebop, hard bop) to intense and searching (free jazz, spiritual jazz) to accessible and smooth (fusion, smooth jazz)

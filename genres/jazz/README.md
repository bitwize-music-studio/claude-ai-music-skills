# Jazz

## Genre Overview

Jazz is an improvisational art form built on swing rhythms, harmonic complexity, and individual expression. Born in New Orleans from blues, ragtime, and African rhythmic traditions, jazz emphasizes instrumental virtuosity, spontaneous dialogue between musicians, and a conversational approach to melody and harmony. From smoky jazz clubs to concert halls, jazz remains one of music's most flexible and evolving genres.

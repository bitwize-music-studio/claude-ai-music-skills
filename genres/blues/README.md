# Blues

## Genre Overview

Blues is a foundational American musical genre characterized by expressive vocals, call-and-response patterns, and instrumental improvisation. Born from African American experiences in the Deep South, blues has evolved from rural Delta traditions to electrified urban sounds, influencing virtually every popular music genre that followed. At its heart, blues is about emotional authenticity and the 12-bar progression that defines its harmonic structure.

## Characteristics

- **Instrumentation**: Acoustic or electric guitar, harmonica, upright bass or electric bass, drums, piano
- **Vocals**: Soulful, emotional, often featuring blues phrasing and bent notes
- **Harmony**: 12-bar blues progression (I-IV-I-V-IV-I)
- **Rhythm**: Swing feel, shuffle rhythms, offbeat accents
- **Production**: Ranges from raw acoustic recordings to heavily amplified electric sound
- **Soul**: Emphasis on feeling and emotional expression over technical perfection

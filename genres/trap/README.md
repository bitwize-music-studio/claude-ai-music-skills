# Trap

## Genre Overview

Trap emerged in the early 2000s from the Southern United States hip-hop scene, primarily in Atlanta, Georgia. The term "trap" derives from the slang for locations where drug deals occur, and the genre's foundational artists drew from this environment to create music that reflected street narratives, hustling culture, and survival in marginalized communities. T.I.'s "Trap Muzik" (2003) and "Urban Legend" (2004) helped codify both the sound and terminology, while producers like DJ Toomp, Shawty Redd, and Drumma Boy established the sonic template that would define the genre.

The production style that emerged was stark and hypnotic: booming 808 kick drums tuned to melodic pitches, crisp snare cracks with heavy reverb, rapid-fire hi-hat patterns (often in triplet rhythms), and dark, atmospheric synthesizers. Unlike the sample-heavy boom-bap of East Coast hip-hop, trap favored synthetic soundscapes that created a tension-filled, cinematic feel. The sparse arrangements emphasized the impact of each element, with vast empty spaces filled by rolling percussion and bass frequencies that demanded powerful sound systems.

Gucci Mane's prolific output in the mid-2000s, particularly his collaborations with Zaytoven, pushed trap toward mainstream recognition, while Jeezy's "Let's Get It: Thug Motivation 101" (2005) demonstrated the genre's commercial potential. The late 2000s and early 2010s brought a new wave: Waka Flocka Flame's aggressive delivery, Lex Luger's bombastic production style, and Future's melodic innovations began reshaping trap's boundaries. By 2012, trap had become the dominant force in hip-hop, influencing everything from pop to electronic dance music.

The genre's influence extended far beyond hip-hop. EDM producers like Flosstradamus, Baauer, and RL Grime adapted trap's rhythmic signatures for festival crowds, creating "EDM trap" or "festival trap." Meanwhile, regional variations emerged: Chicago drill (Chief Keef, Lil Durk), Brooklyn drill (Pop Smoke, Fivio Foreign), UK drill (Headie One, Central Cee), and phonk (a lo-fi Memphis-influenced variant). Today, trap's sonic elements have become so ubiquitous that they underpin much of contemporary pop production, making it arguably the most influential hip-hop subgenre of the 21st century.

## Characteristics

### Production & Sound Design
- **808 Bass**: The genre's foundation. Roland TR-808 bass drums are pitched/tuned to create melodic basslines, often with long sustain and heavy sub-bass. Distortion and saturation add grit. Typical note lengths range from short, punchy hits to sustained drones that carry through entire bars
- **Drums**: Crisp, heavily compressed snares with long reverb tails; rapid hi-hat patterns often programmed in 1/16th or 1/32nd note triplets (creating the signature "hi-hat rolls"); sparse kick patterns that let the 808 bass dominate
- **Synthesizers**: Dark, atmospheric pads; detuned leads; minor key melodies; often filtered or phased. Brass/horn stabs, string sections, and ominous bell tones are common. Arpeggiated synths and plucks add movement
- **Samples**: Sparse vocal chops, horror movie atmospheres, cash register sounds, gun cocking effects, and street ambience. Unlike boom-bap, trap rarely samples full instrumental loops
- **FX Processing**: Heavy sidechain compression on synths/bass, liberal use of reverb and delay, pitch-shifted vocal effects, vinyl crackle (in phonk), distortion on 808s

### Tempo & Rhythm
- **BPM Ranges**:
  - Classic trap: 130-145 BPM (often written as 65-72.5 BPM in half-time feel)
  - Drill: 140-145 BPM (UK drill) / 135-145 BPM (Chicago/Brooklyn drill)
  - Melodic trap: 130-160 BPM
  - Phonk: 120-140 BPM (often slower, 60-70 BPM half-time)
  - EDM trap: 140-150 BPM (full-time feel for drops)
  - Rage/Hyperpop-influenced: 150-180 BPM
- **Rhythmic Feel**: Half-time groove is essential - kicks and snares hit at half the perceived tempo while hi-hats roll rapidly above. This creates the characteristic "slow bounce" feel
- **Hi-Hat Programming**: The signature element. Patterns include 1/32nd note rolls, triplet stutters, pitch-shifted hits, volume-automated swells, and rhythmic variations that create complexity within repetition

### Vocal Approaches
- **Delivery**: Ranges from rapid-fire technical rapping to melodic singing; ad-libs are essential (including "yeah," "skrrt," "brr," gun sounds)
- **Processing**: Auto-Tune (both corrective and as creative effect), vocal doubling, delay throws, reverb tails, pitch-shifted ad-libs
- **Flow Patterns**: Triplet flows became standard after Migos' "Versace" (2013); syncopated patterns that dance around the beat rather than landing squarely on it
- **Hook Styles**: Often melodic and sung rather than rapped; repeated phrases; chant-like simplicity designed for singalong

### Lyrical Themes
- **Street Narratives**: Drug dealing, violence, survival, loyalty, betrayal, police encounters
- **Flexing/Wealth**: Jewelry, cars, designer fashion, financial success
- **Partying**: Drugs, alcohol, clubs, hedonism
- **Relationships**: Often from perspectives of distrust, transactional dynamics, or heartbreak
- **Melodic Trap Addition**: Emotional vulnerability, mental health, addiction, depression (especially post-Juice WRLD/XXXTentacion wave)

### Song Structure
- **Standard Format**: Intro (4-8 bars, often with beat-only or filtered mix) > Hook/Chorus (8-16 bars) > Verse (16-24 bars) > Hook > Verse > Hook > Outro
- **Beat Drops**: Songs often begin with reduced elements that build to a "drop" when full 808 bass enters
- **Breakdowns**: Stripped sections featuring just vocals and minimal instrumentation before beat returns
- **Length**: Typically 2:30-3:30 for streaming optimization; features often extend to 4:00+

## Lyric Conventions

- **Default rhyme scheme**: AABB (loose couplet) or XAXA. Internal rhyme and assonance over complex multisyllabics.
- **Rhyme quality**: Near rhymes and melodic flow valued over technical perfection. Triplet flows common.
- **Verse structure**: 8–16 bars. Lower syllable counts (8–10 per bar) with more space and pauses.
- **Key rule**: Melodic delivery and attitude matter more than lyrical complexity. Snare on 3rd beat.
- **Avoid**: Overly dense wordplay that fights the beat's spacious feel.

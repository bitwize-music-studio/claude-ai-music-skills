# Trap

## Genre Overview

Trap is a hip-hop subgenre that emerged in the early 2000s in the Southern United States, characterized by a distinctive sonic palette dominated by punchy 808 bass drums, rapid-fire hi-hat rolls, and dark, atmospheric synths. The term "trap" references the locations where drug dealers sell their products, and the genre's lyrical content often reflects street narratives, hustling culture, and social commentary. Trap's production is marked by sparse, minimalist arrangements that emphasize the impact of each element, creating a hypnotic, tension-filled sonic landscape. Since its mainstream breakthrough in the early 2010s, trap has evolved far beyond its hip-hop roots, influencing electronic dance music, pop production, and global music production standards.

## Characteristics

- **Instrumentation**: Heavy 808 bass (often tuned and pitched), crisp snare cracks, rapid hi-hat rolls (often triplet-based), dark synthesizers, minimal melodic elements
- **Vocals**: Rapid-fire rap delivery with complex wordplay, often layered or doubled; some tracks feature sung hooks or melodic ad-libs
- **Production**: Minimalist yet dense, lots of empty space filled with rhythmic elements, sidechain compression on drums/bass, heavy use of reverb and echo
- **Energy/Mood**: Dark, tense, aggressive yet hypnotic; creates a cinematic, cinematic sense of urgency and swagger
- **Structure**: Standard hip-hop song structure (intro, verse, chorus/hook, verse, chorus, bridge, outro) with 16-32 bar verses and 8-16 bar hooks

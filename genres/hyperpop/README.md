# HYPERPOP

## Genre Overview

Hyperpop is a maximalist experimental pop genre that emerged from online communities in the 2010s. Characterized by pitch-shifted vocals, distorted synthesizers, glitchy production techniques, and internet culture aesthetics, hyperpop prioritizes creative excess and sonic chaos over commercial polish. It blends elements from bubblegum pop, industrial, glitch, and avant-garde electronic music into a high-energy, often abrasive sound that challenges traditional pop conventions. The genre thrives on digital manipulation, unconventional song structures, and a DIY ethos rooted in online collaboration and distribution.

## Characteristics

- **Instrumentation**: Digital synthesizers (often heavily distorted), 808 drums, chip-tune elements, vocal chops and pitch-shifting, glitchy electronic textures, occasional live instruments filtered through digital effects
- **Vocals**: Pitch-shifted (often falsetto or hyper-elevated), heavily processed, multiple layered vocal lines, sometimes whispered or distorted, emphatic and expressive delivery
- **Production**: Glitchy breakdowns, abrupt transitions, digital artifacts as intentional aesthetic choices, hyper-compressed dynamics, dense layering, lo-fi or deliberately cheap-sounding elements mixed with high-fidelity production
- **Energy/Mood**: Frenetic, chaotic, provocative, euphoric yet unsettling, playful but aggressive, often dark or ironic undertones paired with bubblegum sensibilities
- **Structure**: Non-traditional song structure, chaotic builds, sudden key/tempo changes, repetitive loops interrupted by jarring shifts, minimal verses with explosive choruses

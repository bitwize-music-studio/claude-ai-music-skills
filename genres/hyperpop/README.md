# HYPERPOP

## Genre Overview

Hyperpop is a maximalist experimental pop genre that emerged from online communities and the UK-based PC Music collective in the early-to-mid 2010s. Founded by A.G. Cook in 2013, PC Music became the aesthetic and philosophical nucleus of what would eventually be labeled "hyperpop"—a term popularized by Spotify's influential 2019 playlist of the same name. The collective's artists, including SOPHIE, Hannah Diamond, and Danny L Harle, established a sonic template that treated pop music as both subject and medium: deconstructing, exaggerating, and reconstructing commercial pop's tropes into something simultaneously celebratory and critical.

The genre is characterized by pitch-shifted vocals, distorted synthesizers, glitchy production techniques, and internet culture aesthetics. Hyperpop prioritizes creative excess and sonic chaos over commercial polish, blending elements from bubblegum pop, industrial, nightcore, trance, and avant-garde electronic music into a high-energy, often abrasive sound that challenges traditional pop conventions. Early hyperpop drew from the glossy digital textures of J-pop and K-pop, the speed and pitch manipulation of nightcore, the maximalism of EDM, and the conceptual playfulness of art-pop predecessors like Björk and Aphex Twin.

By the late 2010s, hyperpop had fractured into distinct scenes: the UK's PC Music axis maintained its conceptual art-pop focus; American artists like 100 gecs introduced elements of ska, metal, and country into the chaos; and a new generation of bedroom producers on SoundCloud and Discord created digicore—a lo-fi, emo-inflected variant that became TikTok's soundtrack. The tragic death of SOPHIE in 2021 marked a turning point, as the genre's most visionary figure was mourned while her influence continued to permeate mainstream pop through Charli XCX, Rina Sawayama, and countless others.

Hyperpop thrives on digital manipulation, unconventional song structures, and a DIY ethos rooted in online collaboration and distribution. Its aesthetic sensibility—maximalist, ironic, queer, and digitally native—reflects the experience of growing up online, where identity is fluid, culture is remixed endlessly, and the boundary between authentic emotion and performative excess becomes meaningless. The genre continues to evolve, influencing mainstream pop production while maintaining vibrant underground scenes across platforms from SoundCloud to Bandcamp.

## Characteristics

- **Instrumentation**: Digital synthesizers (often heavily distorted or with aggressive LFO modulation), 808 and 909 drum machines, chiptune elements, vocal chops and pitch-shifting, glitchy electronic textures, trance leads, hardcore synth stabs, occasional live instruments filtered through extreme digital effects; bass design ranges from rubbery sub-bass to harsh distorted square waves

- **Vocals**: Pitch-shifted (often to extremes—falsetto, chipmunk-high, or bass-deep), heavily processed with formant shifting, multiple layered vocal lines creating dense harmonic textures, whispered or distorted passages, Auto-Tune as stylistic choice rather than correction, emphatic and expressive delivery, often gender-ambiguous or deliberately androgynous vocal presentation

- **Production**: Glitchy breakdowns with stuttered audio, abrupt transitions between sections, digital artifacts (clipping, aliasing, bitcrushing) as intentional aesthetic choices, hyper-compressed dynamics with extreme loudness, dense layering sometimes to the point of sensory overload, lo-fi or deliberately cheap-sounding elements juxtaposed with high-fidelity production, sidechain pumping as rhythmic element, trance gates, aggressive limiting

- **Energy/Mood**: Frenetic and chaotic, provocative, euphoric yet unsettling, playful but aggressive, often dark or ironic undertones paired with saccharine bubblegum sensibilities; emotional sincerity masked by or expressed through irony; themes of heartbreak, identity, internet alienation, and queer experience; simultaneously celebratory and critical of pop culture

- **Structure**: Non-traditional song structures with chaotic builds and sudden drops, unexpected key/tempo changes (sometimes mid-phrase), repetitive loops interrupted by jarring shifts, minimal verses with explosive choruses, genre-switching within single tracks, dramatic breakdowns, songs that feel like channel-surfing through multiple genres

# Metal

## Genre Overview

Metal emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s from the heavier end of blues rock and psychedelia, crystallizing into a distinct genre with Black Sabbath's self-titled debut in 1970. Tony Iommi's detuned, doom-laden riffs and Ozzy Osbourne's eerie vocals established the template: dark themes, heavy distortion, and an emphasis on power over pop accessibility.

The 1970s saw the genre solidify through the New Wave of British Heavy Metal (NWOBHM), with bands like Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, and Motorhead adding speed, twin-guitar harmonies, and leather-clad theatricality. This movement directly spawned the 1980s thrash explosion in the San Francisco Bay Area, where Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth, and Exodus fused NWOBHM aggression with hardcore punk velocity.

The late 1980s and 1990s brought extreme metal's divergence: death metal emerged from Florida (Death, Morbid Angel, Obituary) and Sweden (Entombed, Dismember), while black metal coalesced in Norway through Mayhem, Burzum, and Emperor, infamous for both its atmospheric ambition and real-world violence. Simultaneously, doom metal traced Sabbath's slowest moments to crushing conclusions through Candlemass and Cathedral, while progressive metal (Dream Theater, Fates Warning) pushed technical boundaries.

The 2000s saw metal fragment further: metalcore merged hardcore breakdowns with melodic death metal, djent introduced polyrhythmic complexity, and classic styles experienced revivals. Today, metal remains one of the most globally active underground music scenes, with dedicated festivals, labels, and communities spanning every continent.

## Characteristics

### Sonic Elements
- **Instrumentation**: Distorted electric guitars (often multiple), bass guitar, drums (frequently double-kick), keyboards/synthesizers in some subgenres, orchestral elements in symphonic styles
- **Tunings**: Standard E (classic), Drop D (groove/nu-metal), C/B/A (death metal, djent), varied alternate tunings
- **Distortion**: High-gain tube amplifiers, tight low-end, scooped or mid-heavy EQ depending on subgenre
- **Drums**: Emphasis on double bass, blast beats (extreme styles), complex fills, often triggered/replaced in modern production

### Vocal Approaches
- **Clean**: Operatic (power metal), raspy (traditional), melodic (progressive)
- **Harsh**: Growls (death metal), screams (black metal), shouts (thrash), pig squeals (deathcore)
- **Hybrid**: Many modern bands combine clean and harsh vocals for dynamic contrast

### Production Specifics
- **Guitar Tone**: High-gain amplifiers (Mesa Boogie, Peavey 5150, Kemper profiles), palm-muted chugging, harmonized leads
- **Bass**: Often following guitar riffs, sometimes with distinct distortion (Steve Harris style) or clean for low-end foundation
- **Drums**: Heavily compressed, triggered kicks common in extreme metal, natural sounds preferred in traditional/doom
- **Mix Philosophy**: Guitars prominent, vocals cutting through, bass providing low-end weight, drums punchy and present

### Tempo & Structure
- **BPM Ranges**:
  - Doom metal: 40-80 BPM
  - Heavy/traditional metal: 100-140 BPM
  - Thrash metal: 150-220 BPM
  - Death metal: 140-280 BPM (including blast beat sections)
  - Black metal: 120-200 BPM (tremolo sections faster)
  - Power metal: 140-180 BPM
- **Song Lengths**: 3-6 minutes typical, progressive/doom often 8-15+ minutes
- **Structure**: Verse-chorus framework with extended instrumental sections, guitar solos, breakdowns, tempo changes, dynamic buildups

### Thematic Content
- **Traditional**: Power, freedom, rebellion, fantasy, mythology, war
- **Extreme**: Death, violence, anti-religion, Satanism, occultism, cosmic horror
- **Progressive**: Philosophy, conceptual narratives, science fiction, introspection
- **Political**: Social commentary, anti-establishment, environmental concerns

## Lyric Conventions

- **Default rhyme scheme**: Optional — metal prioritizes intensity, imagery, and rhythmic power over end rhymes.
- **Rhyme quality**: Use rhyme when it strengthens the line. Skip it when it weakens imagery. Phonetic punch and cadence matter more.
- **Verse structure**: Variable — lyrics must fit the riff. Rhythmic alignment with the music is the priority.
- **Key rule**: Concrete imagery over everything. A skull, a factory, a blizzard — specific images beat vague concepts. Conflict is mandatory.
- **Avoid**: Forced rhymes over meaning. Vague abstractions. Ignoring the riff's rhythm.
- **Density/pacing (Suno)**: Default **6-8 lines/verse** at 100-140 BPM. Vocal delivery (clean/growl/scream) compresses syllables — metal handles more density than tempo alone suggests. Topics: 2-3/verse.

## Reference Tracks

- **Black Sabbath - "Paranoid" (1970)**: The prototype for metal songwriting. Simple but devastating riff, Ozzy's manic delivery, and lyrics touching on mental health made this an unlikely hit that defined the genre's DNA.
- **Judas Priest - "Breaking the Law" (1980)**: NWOBHM's commercial breakthrough. K.K. Downing and Glenn Tipton's twin guitars, Rob Halford's leather-clad power, and an instantly recognizable riff that remains a metal anthem.

### Thrash Metal
- **Metallica - "Master of Puppets" (1986)**: Thrash's magnum opus. Eight minutes of tempo changes, clean interludes, and relentless aggression about addiction. James Hetfield's riffing and Lars Ulrich's drumming at their peak synchronization.
- **Slayer - "Raining Blood" (1986)**: Pure violence in four minutes. The opening thunder-to-tremolo transition and Tom Araya's scream are iconic; Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman's chaotic soloing defined extreme thrash.

### Death Metal
- **Death - "Pull the Plug" (1988)**: Chuck Schuldiner invented death metal here. The Florida sound: swampy production, intelligent lyrics about euthanasia, and riffs that balanced brutality with memorability.
- **Morbid Angel - "Chapel of Ghouls" (1989)**: Trey Azagthoth's otherworldly guitar tone and David Vincent's cavernous growl. Satanic themes delivered with genuine menace and technical prowess.
- **Cannibal Corpse - "Hammer Smashed Face" (1992)**: Death metal's most notorious band at their most brutal. Chris Barnes' guttural vocals and the relentless, grinding riff became the genre's calling card.

### Black Metal

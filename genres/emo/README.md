# Emo

## Genre Overview

Emo is an emotional, introspective rock genre built on vulnerability, melody, and raw feeling. Emerging from post-hardcore and indie rock, emo emphasizes personal storytelling, layered guitars, and vocal delivery that communicates genuine emotion over technical perfection. From the math-rock complexity of midwest emo to the polished pop-punk sound of emo pop, the genre spans decades of evolution while maintaining its core focus on emotional authenticity and melodic hooks.

## Characteristics

- **Instrumentation**: Electric guitar (often layered and distorted), bass guitar, drums, sometimes keys or string arrangements
- **Vocals**: Emotional, often strained or pained, ranging from sung to screamed depending on subgenre
- **Production**: Ranges from lo-fi bedroom recordings to polished studio sound
- **Lyrics**: Introspective, personal storytelling, often dealing with relationships, loss, identity, existential themes

# Reggae

## Genre Overview

Reggae is a Jamaican musical genre rooted in ska, rocksteady, and American R&B, characterized by a distinctive rhythm pattern and emphasis on social commentary, spirituality, and cultural pride. Emerging in the late 1960s, reggae is defined by its steady, hypnotic beat, reggae bass lines, and a strong emphasis on groove and feeling over technical virtuosity. The genre carries messages of unity, resistance, and Rastafarian philosophy while maintaining infectious rhythms ideal for both dancing and reflection.

## Characteristics

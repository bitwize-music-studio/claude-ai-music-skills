# Punk

## Genre Overview

Punk rock exploded in the mid-1970s as a visceral rejection of the bloated excess of arena rock and progressive rock. The movement emerged simultaneously in New York City and London, each scene developing its own distinct character while sharing core values of raw energy, simplicity, and anti-establishment defiance.

**New York (1974-1976)**: The scene coalesced around CBGB club in the Bowery, where bands like the Ramones, Television, Patti Smith, and the Dead Boys stripped rock down to its essentials. The Ramones' 1976 debut album, recorded in under $7,000, became the template for punk's aesthetic: fast, loud, and over in under two minutes per song. New York punk drew from garage rock, the Velvet Underground's art-noise experiments, and the proto-punk of the Stooges and MC5.

**London (1976-1978)**: British punk erupted with the Sex Pistols' anarchic performances and the Clash's politically charged anthems. Where American punk had art-school leanings, UK punk was explicitly class-conscious, emerging from unemployment, social decay, and Thatcher-era austerity. The scene spawned not just music but fashion (Malcolm McLaren's SEX boutique), visual art (Jamie Reid's ransom-note graphics), and a philosophy of confrontation. The 1977 release of "Never Mind the Bollocks" and "The Clash" defined the British sound: snarling, aggressive, and unapologetically political.

**Evolution (1978-1990s)**: By the late 1970s, punk fractured into diverse subgenres. Hardcore punk emerged in Los Angeles (Black Flag), Washington D.C. (Minor Threat), and Boston (SS Decontrol), pushing speed and aggression to new extremes. Post-punk bands like Joy Division and Siouxsie and the Banshees incorporated synthesizers, darker textures, and intellectual pretension. The anarcho-punk movement (Crass, Conflict) made politics explicit, while Oi! (Sham 69, Cockney Rejects) embraced working-class identity.

**Modern Era (1990s-Present)**: Pop-punk's commercial breakthrough with Green Day's "Dookie" (1994) and Blink-182's "Enema of the State" (1999) brought punk's melodic side to mainstream audiences. Meanwhile, hardcore continued evolving through metalcore, post-hardcore, and screamo. Contemporary punk maintains the DIY ethic while addressing modern issues, with bands like IDLES and Turnstile finding critical and commercial success by blending punk with diverse influences.

## Characteristics

### Instrumentation
- **Electric Guitar**: One or two guitars playing power chords (root-fifth-octave), minimal lead work, heavy distortion, often downstroked for maximum attack
- **Bass Guitar**: Following guitar chords or providing melodic counterpoint; often distorted in hardcore styles
- **Drums**: Simple but driving patterns emphasizing snare backbeat; fast 4/4 or 2/4 time signatures; crash cymbals for emphasis
- **Vocals**: Range from melodic (pop-punk) to shouted (hardcore) to spoken/sneered (classic punk); untrained quality valued over technical polish

### Tempo & Rhythm
- **Classic Punk**: 140-170 BPM, 4/4 time, driving eighth-note rhythms
- **Hardcore Punk**: 180-220+ BPM, often incorporating D-beat (galloping bass drum pattern) or blast beats
- **Pop-Punk**: 120-160 BPM, emphasis on catchiness over speed
- **Post-Punk**: 100-140 BPM, more varied and atmospheric rhythms
- **Street Punk**: 150-180 BPM, emphasis on singalong patterns

### Production Aesthetics
- **Classic/Raw**: Lo-fi recording quality, room sound, bleeding between instruments, minimal overdubs; exemplified by early Ramones and Dead Kennedys recordings
- **Hardcore**: Aggressive but clearer production; heavy compression on drums; prominent bass; vocals pushed forward in mix
- **Pop-Punk**: Polished, radio-ready production with layered guitars, tight performances, and vocal clarity while retaining energy
- **Post-Punk**: Spacious production with reverb, delay effects, angular guitar tones (chorus, flanger), prominent bass lines
- **Modern Punk**: Varies widely; can be raw or polished but typically maintains dynamic range and live energy

### Song Structure
- **Length**: 1:30-3:00 for classic/hardcore; up to 4:00 for pop-punk and post-punk
- **Form**: Verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus (standard); many hardcore songs skip bridges entirely
- **Arrangements**: Minimal; rarely more than guitar, bass, drums, vocals; occasional keyboards in post-punk
- **Dynamics**: Often uniformly loud; post-punk and some modern punk incorporate quiet/loud dynamics

### Attitude & Themes
- **Anti-Establishment**: Rejection of authority, mainstream culture, corporate music industry
- **DIY Ethic**: Self-released records, zines, independent labels, booking your own shows
- **Authenticity**: Prioritizing genuine expression over technical perfection
- **Community**: Scene-building, all-ages shows, accessible ticket prices
- **Lyrical Themes**: Political critique, personal alienation, social commentary, anti-war, working-class struggles, suburban ennui (pop-punk), existential despair (post-punk)

## Lyric Conventions

- **Default rhyme scheme**: AABB (loose) or ABAB — but sloppy execution is authentic.
- **Rhyme quality**: Half-rhymes and slant rhymes are standard. Imperfect rhymes signal authenticity. Polished rhymes sound pretentious.
- **Verse structure**: Short — 4–6 lines. Songs under 3 minutes. Lines must work at 150–200 BPM.
- **Key rule**: Directness over poetry. Simple, punchy, shoutable. Authenticity is punk's cardinal virtue.
- **Avoid**: Pretentious vocabulary. Flowery descriptions. Complex sentence structures. Anything that sounds "carefully written."

## Subgenres & Styles

| Style | Description | Tempo | Production | Reference Artists |
|-------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|

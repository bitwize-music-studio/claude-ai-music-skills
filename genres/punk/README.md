# Punk

Punk rock emerged in the 1970s as a reaction against the complexity of progressive rock, emphasizing raw energy, simplicity, and anti-establishment attitude. Built on fast tempos, distorted guitars, and confrontational lyrics, punk prioritizes authenticity and DIY ethic over technical perfection.

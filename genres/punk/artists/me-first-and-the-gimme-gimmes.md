# Me First and the Gimme Gimmes — Deep Dive

## Overview

Me First and the Gimme Gimmes are a punk rock supergroup and cover band formed in San Francisco in 1995. The band's entire concept is deceptively simple: take well-known songs from non-punk genres — show tunes, country, R&B ballads, folk standards, diva pop anthems — and blast through them at breakneck punk speed. The joke is the concept itself, but the execution is deadly serious. Every member's day job is in a legitimate, respected punk band, and they bring that musicianship to bear on songs originally performed by Barry Manilow, Dolly Parton, and Barbra Streisand.

The band is named after a children's book of the same name by Gerald G. Jampolsky and Diane V. Cirincione. They formed from the Fat Wreck Chords ecosystem — Fat Mike founded the label, Spike Slawson worked in its mail-order department, and the other members were all on the roster or in adjacent bands. The project began as a series of themed 7-inch singles (named after the artists being covered), with no initial intention to release full albums. Their first release was the *Denver* 7-inch EP in 1995, featuring punk covers of two John Denver songs: "Country Roads" and "Leaving on a Jet Plane."

Their first live performance was on April 20, 1996, at the Chameleon Club in San Francisco.

What separates the Gimme Gimmes from a bar band doing ironic covers is the pedigree. These are members of NOFX, Foo Fighters, Lagwagon, Swingin' Utters, and No Use for a Name — veterans of melodic punk who understand song structure, dynamics, and hooks at a professional level. The covers work because the band respects the melodies enough to keep them recognizable while completely reinventing the arrangement. As one critic put it: their approach "is less about innovation and more about invigoration — they breathe new, raucous life into tunes your parents might have slow-danced to at prom."

The band has released all of their material on Fat Wreck Chords.

## Members

### Original Lineup (1995-2018)

#### Spike Slawson — Lead Vocals (1995-present)

- **Full name:** Sean "Spike" Slawson
- **Born:** April 9, 1970
- **Day job bands:** Swingin' Utters, Re-Volts, Filthy Thievin' Bastards, Uke-Hunt, Los Nuevos Bajos
- **How he got the gig:** Slawson worked in the mail order / shipping and receiving department at Fat Wreck Chords. His witty personality and powerful singing voice led label roster members to form a supergroup around him. As Spike tells it, he got a call to cover shipping and receiving — "not very well though, which is why they found me another position in the organisation, which was singer in his new covers band."
- **Vocal style:** Frequently described as a "crooner" — a punk rock lounge singer. His vocal delivery has a smooth, warm quality that contrasts sharply with the thrashing instrumentation behind him. This is central to why the covers work: he treats the melodies with genuine affection rather than sneering contempt. His voice bridges the gap between the original song's emotional intent and the punk arrangement's aggression.
- **AM Gold affinity:** Spike has expressed deep love for "all of that AM Gold stuff from the States. That quiet rock... I just want to do all of that" — the soft rock and easy listening hits of the 1970s that form the Gimme Gimmes' core source material.
- **The constant:** Spike is the only member who has been present throughout every era of the band.

#### Chris Shiflett — Guitar (1995-~2018)

- **Day job bands:** No Use for a Name (1996-1997), Foo Fighters (1999-present; longest-tenured lead guitarist)
- **Departure:** On June 7, 2019, during a Reddit AMA, Shiflett revealed he was "no longer involved." He stated that "when the Gimmes decided to start releasing songs that I didn't play on it was time for me to leave," adding it was "on bad terms."
- **Replaced by:** His brother Scott Shiflett (of Face to Face, Viva Death) initially filled in on tours. Later replaced by John "Swami" Reis.

#### Joey Cape — Guitar (1995-present)

- **Day job band:** Lagwagon (vocalist/guitarist, 1990-present)
- **Other projects:** Solo acoustic career, Bad Astronaut
- **Note:** Has remained with the Gimme Gimmes throughout all lineup changes. His Lagwagon bandmate Dave Raun was the original drummer.

- **Status:** Listed as a former member. Made guest appearances (e.g., May 2021 Saturday Night Special livestream) but is no longer a regular member.
- **2025 announcement:** On April 21, 2025, Fat Mike and Spike jointly announced the touring band would be called "Spike and the Gimme Gimmes" going forward.

#### Dave Raun — Drums (1995-~2018)

- **Day job band:** Lagwagon (drummer, 1990-present)

### Compilation Albums

#### Have Another Ball (2008)

- **Theme:** More classic rock/pop (same era as *Have a Ball*)
- **Content:** Outtakes from the *Have a Ball* sessions plus tracks that had appeared on compilations and singles over the years. Not a true studio album — a collection of previously scattered material.

#### Rake It In: The Greatestest Hits (2017)

- **Type:** Greatest hits compilation
- **Significance:** Career-spanning overview pulling the best tracks from across their themed albums. Good single-disc entry point for new listeners.

### Live Albums

#### Ruin Jonny's Bar Mitzvah (2004)

- **Concept:** Recorded at an actual bar mitzvah. The band covered karaoke favorites for a crowd that hadn't necessarily asked for punk rock.
- **Significance:** Established the Gimme Gimmes' tradition of crashing real events.

#### Blow It... at Madison's Quinceañera (2024)

- **Released:** June 14, 2024
- **Concept:** Spiritual sequel to *Ruin Jonny's Bar Mitzvah* — recorded at an actual quinceañera. Nobody in attendance had ever heard of the band.
- **First single:** "Dancing Queen" (ABBA cover)
- **Spike Slawson quote:** "It was really tense for me going out to no applause — and to people actually walking away when we were playing. Our process is to cast the line out and bring people to the point of — and beyond — outward expressions of displeasure like booing, and then hopefully reel them back in by the end of the set."

### EPs

#### Denver (1995)

- **Format:** 7-inch single
- **Tracks:** "Country Roads" / "Leaving on a Jet Plane" (both John Denver covers)
- **Significance:** First Gimme Gimmes release. Established the themed-single format.

#### Go Down Under (2011)

- **Theme:** Australian songs (released to coincide with an Australian tour)
- **Format:** 5-track EP
- **Significance:** First "world EP" — instead of covering a genre, they covered a continent's music.
- **Tracklist:**

| # | Cover | Original Artist |
|---|-------|-----------------|
| 1 | Never Tear Us Apart | INXS |
| 2 | All Out of Love | Air Supply |
| 3 | Friday on My Mind | The Easybeats |
| 4 | Have You Never Been Mellow | Olivia Newton-John |
| 5 | I've Done Everything for You | Rick Springfield |

- **Notable detail:** The intro of Black Flag's "Rise Above" converges into a whiplash version of "All Out of Love." Cover art features Fat Mike eating a Vegemite sandwich next to a kangaroo. Deliberately ignored obvious choices like Men at Work and AC/DC.

#### Sing in Japanese (2011)

- **Theme:** Japanese pop and rock classics
- **Format:** 6-track EP (released for Japanese tour)
- **Recorded at:** Foo Fighters' 606 Studio
- **Significance:** Second "world EP"
- **Tracklist:**

| # | Cover | Original Artist |
|---|-------|-----------------|

| 4 | C-C-C | The Tigers (1968) |

## Musical Analysis — How the Covers Formula Works

### The Transformation Process

The Gimme Gimmes have a clear, repeatable formula for converting any song into punk:

1. **Speed it up dramatically.** A 4-minute ballad becomes a 2-minute sprint. Tempos jump from 80-100 BPM originals to 160-200 BPM punk arrangements.
2. **Replace the instrumentation.** Strings, horns, piano, and synths are stripped out. Everything becomes distorted guitars, driving bass, and pounding drums — standard punk power trio instrumentation.
3. **Keep the melody intact.** This is the critical difference between the Gimme Gimmes and a band just playing fast and sloppy. The vocal melodies are preserved nearly note-for-note. Spike sings the actual tune, not a punk approximation of it.
4. **Weave in punk riffs.** The band is known for inserting famous riffs and intros from classic punk songs into their covers. A cover might open with the guitar line from The Clash's "London Calling" before launching into "Elenore" by The Turtles. Riffs from Black Flag, Bad Religion, The Offspring, Ramones, Sex Pistols, and The Misfits appear throughout their catalog as winking references for punk fans.
5. **Play it straight.** Despite the inherent humor of the concept, the band does not mock the songs. There is no ironic vocal delivery, no comedic pauses, no winking at the camera. They play the songs as if they were always meant to be punk — and that commitment is why the project transcends novelty.

### Why It Works

The formula works because the songs they choose are melodically strong to begin with. Show tunes, Motown, country standards, and pop diva anthems all share a common trait: bulletproof melodies written by professional songwriters at the top of their craft. Punk rock, at its core, is also melodically driven — the Ramones proved that three chords and a great vocal hook is all you need. The Gimme Gimmes exploit that common ground.

The effect on listeners operates on two levels simultaneously:

- **For punk fans:** They hear aggressive melodic power chords over familiar-but-unexpected source material. The recognition factor creates delight — "I can't believe they're playing 'My Heart Will Go On' as a punk song, and it actually works."
- **For general audiences:** The covers make punk accessible. People who would never listen to NOFX or Lagwagon find themselves enjoying fast punk rock because the songs are already familiar.

As one analysis put it: "Presenting these songs in this fashion is enough to persuade old-school punk connoisseurs to finally make peace with their musical prejudices and accept that they actually liked these classics in their original form all along."

### What Doesn't Work

Not every song survives the transformation equally. Songs with complex, melismatic vocal runs (heavy R&B, gospel-influenced pop) lose something when compressed into straight punk vocal delivery. Songs whose emotional impact depends entirely on tempo and dynamics (slow-burn ballads) can feel flattened rather than energized. The band's worst moments are when a song's identity is entirely in its production rather than its melody — strip that away and there is nothing for punk to grab onto.

### Spike Slawson's Vocal Approach

Spike's voice is the engine that makes the whole project function. He is frequently described as a "crooner" — and that is accurate. His vocal tone is warm, smooth, and genuinely melodic, sitting in sharp contrast to the snarling punk instrumentation around him. He does not adopt a punk sneer or shout the melodies. He sings them with the same emotional sincerity the original artists brought, just at twice the speed over distorted guitars.

This creates the Gimme Gimmes' signature tension: the voice says "this is a beautiful love song" while the band says "this is a 180 BPM punk track." That friction is the entire aesthetic.

### The Musicianship Factor

The Gimme Gimmes are not a sloppy joke band. The members are elite players from the upper tier of melodic punk:

- Joey Cape (Lagwagon) brings technical guitar proficiency and an ear for melody
- Chris Shiflett (Foo Fighters, No Use for a Name) added professional-grade lead guitar work
- Fat Mike (NOFX) provided melodic, driving bass with Fat Wreck production standards
- Dave Raun (Lagwagon) delivered precise, fast drumming
- The current lineup's CJ Ramone, John Reis (Rocket from the Crypt), and Pinch (The Damned) maintain equally high caliber

The covers sound tight because they are played by musicians who have been touring and recording at professional level for decades. The jokes land because the musicianship is never the joke.

## Live Show Reputation

### The Tiki Bar and Costumes

Concerts are often interrupted between songs so band members can freshen cocktails at an on-stage tiki bar. The band dresses in themed costumes matching each album — cowboy outfits for country songs, drag for show tunes, etc. The visual component reinforces the conceptual commitment: they do not just play themed albums, they inhabit them.

### Crowd Dynamic

The Gimme Gimmes' live shows function differently from a typical punk show. Because the songs are universally known, audience participation is immediate and massive — everyone in the room already knows the words to "Sweet Caroline" and "Jolene." This creates a singalong energy that bridges punk fans and casual concertgoers.

Spike Slawson has described their live approach: "Our process is to cast the line out and bring people to the point of — and beyond — outward expressions of displeasure like booing, and then hopefully reel them back in by the end of the set."

### Event Crashing

Two live albums document the band performing at events where they were not the expected entertainment:
- *Ruin Jonny's Bar Mitzvah* (2004) — a real bar mitzvah
- *Blow It... at Madison's Quinceañera* (2024) — a real quinceañera

This guerrilla-performance tradition reinforces their punk ethos while generating genuinely chaotic, entertaining recordings.

## Cultural Significance

### Pioneers of the Punk Cover Concept

Even though punk bands covering non-punk songs was not a new idea when the Gimme Gimmes debuted in 1995 — the Ramones covered oldies, the Dead Kennedys covered "Viva Las Vegas" — no band had ever made it their entire identity. The Gimme Gimmes defined the dedicated punk cover band as a concept, and for years afterward, any punk cover that surfaced was attributed to them regardless of who actually performed it.

### Influence on Cover Culture

The Gimme Gimmes preceded and arguably paved the way for Fearless Records' *Punk Goes Pop* compilation series (launched 2000), which commercialized the concept of punk bands covering pop songs. While the *Punk Goes...* series became enormously successful (2.5 million cumulative album sales, quarter-billion streams), the Gimme Gimmes established the proof-of-concept: that punk fans would enthusiastically embrace hearing familiar non-punk songs played fast and loud.

The key distinction: the Gimme Gimmes always maintain the heart and melody of the original song. The *Punk Goes...* series often reimagined songs more drastically. The Gimme Gimmes' approach — reverent melody, irreverent arrangement — became the template for how punk covers could work without feeling cynical.

### The Supergroup Tradition

The Gimme Gimmes demonstrated that punk supergroups could work as ongoing concerns rather than one-off collaborations. The concept of established musicians from different bands forming a side project with a specific conceptual mandate has since been replicated across punk and adjacent genres.

### Longevity

Nearly 30 years of activity (1995-present) as an exclusively cover band — with no original material — is virtually unprecedented in punk rock. The band has survived multiple lineup changes, the departure of its founder (Fat Mike), and a complete identity transition (to "Spike and the Gimme Gimmes") while maintaining its audience and touring schedule.

### The Art of the Cover

At their best, the Gimme Gimmes make an argument about the universality of great songwriting. If "Jolene" works as a Dolly Parton country ballad AND as a 160 BPM punk song, that says something profound about the quality of Dolly Parton's melody. The Gimme Gimmes are, paradoxically, one of the greatest advertisements for the songwriters they cover.

## Reference Tracks (Essential Gimme Gimmes Covers)

### Defining the Concept
- **"Somewhere Over the Rainbow"** (*Are a Drag*, 1999) — Originally from *The Wizard of Oz*. Their most recognizable track. Featured in *Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story* (2004), *Queer as Folk*, *Raising Hope*, and *Hellcats*. The ultimate proof-of-concept: one of the most beloved songs in American music history works as a fast punk song. If you listen to one Gimme Gimmes track, make it this one.

### Best Genre Transformations
- **"Jolene"** (*Love Their Country*, 2006) — Originally by Dolly Parton. One of their most famous pieces. The desperate pleading of the original becomes frantic punk urgency. Demonstrates how emotional intensity translates across genres.
- **"My Heart Will Go On"** (*Are We Not Men? We Are Diva!*, 2014) — Originally by Celine Dion. The most audacious choice on the diva album — the *Titanic* theme as breakneck punk. The sheer absurdity makes it work.
- **"End of the Road"** (*Take a Break*, 2003) — Originally by Boyz II Men. Silky a cappella R&B transformed into charging punk. Maximum contrast between source and result.

### Fan Favorites
- **"Danny's Song"** (*Have a Ball*, 1997) — Originally by Loggins and Messina. A warm, sentimental 1970s soft-rock classic turned into one of the punchiest pop-punk songs in their catalog. Spike's vocal warmth shines.
- **"Goodbye Earl"** (*Love Their Country*, 2006) — Originally by the Dixie Chicks. The dark murder-ballad humor of the original is amplified by punk energy. A natural fit for the genre.
- **"Country Roads"** (*Denver* EP, 1995; *Rake It In*, 2017) — Originally by John Denver. Their very first recorded track. Featured in *Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul* (2017). The song that started the entire project.

### Punk Riff Integration
- **"Elenore"** (*Blow in the Wind*, 2001) — Originally by The Turtles. Opens with The Clash's "London Calling" guitar riff before launching into the 1960s pop cover. A fan favorite specifically because of this punk-crossover moment.
- **"All Out of Love"** (*Go Down Under*, 2011) — Originally by Air Supply. Opens with Black Flag's "Rise Above" intro before morphing into the candlelight ballad at whiplash speed.

### Best Introduction
- **"I Believe I Can Fly"** (*Take a Break*, 2003) — Originally by R. Kelly. The sheer incongruity of this inspirational power ballad as punk rock captures everything the Gimme Gimmes are about in under two minutes.

### Latest Era
- **"Dancing Queen"** (single, 2024) — Originally by ABBA. First single from the quinceañera live album. Proves the formula still works 29 years in.

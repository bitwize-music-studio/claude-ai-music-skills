# Propagandhi — Deep Dive

## Overview

Propagandhi is a Canadian punk rock and metal band formed in 1986 in Portage la Prairie, Manitoba, by guitarist/vocalist Chris Hannah and drummer Jord Samolesky. Over nearly four decades, the band has evolved from a fast, catchy skate punk act into one of the most technically accomplished and intellectually demanding bands in punk, blending melodic hardcore, thrash metal, and progressive song structures with densely literate, radically left-wing lyrics.

The band's arc is one of the most dramatic evolutions in punk history. Their debut *How to Clean Everything* (1993) was a classic Fat Wreck Chords skate punk record — fast, fun, politically charged but melodically accessible. By *Today's Empires, Tomorrow's Ashes* (2001), they had mutated into something far heavier and more complex, incorporating thrash metal riffing, progressive structures, and a ferocity that shocked fans expecting another skate punk album. Each subsequent record pushed further into technical territory while maintaining punk's urgency and directness.

Propagandhi's politics are not decorative. The band's members are committed anarchists, vegans, and activists whose lyrics address capitalism, imperialism, nationalism, homophobia, racism, sexism, and organized religion with an intellectual rigor unusual in punk. Chris Hannah co-founded the G7 Welcoming Committee Records label with Jord Samolesky, structuring it around the participatory economics model of Robin Hahnel and Michael Albert. The band donates to and organizes around causes rather than merely writing about them.

Hannah has described the band's sound simply: "We're all just generally fans of heavy music — whether it's metal or punk. We're neither a metal band or a punk band. We just like heavy loud rock and keep pushing ourselves to try to get a bit better." That restless self-improvement — both musically and politically — is the through-line of Propagandhi's career.

## Members

### Chris Hannah — Vocals, Guitar (1986–present)

- **From:** Portage la Prairie, Manitoba, Canada
- **Role:** Primary vocalist, guitarist, co-principal songwriter (shares writing duties with Kowalski)
- **Musical background:** Started as a teenage metalhead wanting to form a thrash band influenced by Kreator, Voivod, Celtic Frost, and Sacrifice. After hearing Bad Religion's *Suffer* — which sounded to him like "Motorhead meets the Ramones" — he realized he and Samolesky could play that style. As the band's technical abilities grew over decades, they could finally achieve the thrash-metal-meets-punk vision Hannah originally intended in 1986.
- **Guitar setup:** Primary guitar is a 1997 Gibson SG (purchased at a gas station), modded with a Bare Knuckle Alnico NailBomb bridge pickup and an EverTune bridge for tuning stability. Strung with Ernie Ball .011–.052 sets, tuned down a half-step with the low string dropped to C# (Drop C#). Runs through a Fractal Audio Axe-FX II. Uses Dunlop .73mm Tortex Standard picks.
- **Vocal style:** Aggressive, nasal punk bark with genuine melodic sensibility. Can shift from strained shout to melodic singing within a phrase. Lyrics are delivered with conviction and clarity — every word intended to be heard and understood.
- **Pseudonym:** Briefly adopted the name "Glen Lambert" around the release of *Potemkin City Limits* (2005), confusing fans and reviewers.
- **G7 Welcoming Committee Records:** Co-founded with Jord Samolesky. The label operated as a worker-owned collective based on participatory economics. Released The Weakerthans' first two albums, plus nearly 60 other releases. Fat Mike of NOFX loaned Hannah and Samolesky $50,000 to start the label; they recouped within months. The label eventually closed operations around 2012.
- **Cited influences:** Death, Sepultura, Celtic Frost, Voivod, Kreator, Sacrifice, Venom, Metallica, Slayer, Exodus, Bad Religion, Dead Kennedys, COC, SNFU, Judas Priest, Descendents

### Jord Samolesky — Drums (1986–present)

- **From:** Portage la Prairie, Manitoba, Canada
- **Role:** Co-founder, drummer, co-founder of G7 Welcoming Committee Records
- **Drumming style:** Technically proficient with a punk foundation. Capable of blast beats, thrash-metal double-time passages, and intricate fill work while maintaining the driving energy required for punk. His playing evolved alongside the band's music — from straightforward skate punk beats to complex, demanding patterns that navigate constant tempo and style changes.
- **Background:** The punk half of the original Hannah-Samolesky partnership (Hannah was the metalhead). Their complementary tastes — Samolesky's punk sensibility and Hannah's metal ambitions — defined the band's trajectory.

### Todd Kowalski — Bass, Vocals (1997–present)

- **From:** Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada
- **Joined:** 1997, replacing John K. Samson after *Less Talk, More Rock*
- **Previous bands:** I Spy (touring mates of Propagandhi), Swallowing Shit (political grindcore)
- **How he joined:** Was Hannah's roommate. Had been encouraged by friends to audition for the bass position even before Samson joined, but the timing never worked out until Samson's departure. His aggressive songwriting and musical sensibilities aligned closely with Hannah's and Samolesky's vision for the band's heavier direction.
- **Role:** Co-principal songwriter with Hannah. His addition was a turning point — *Today's Empires, Tomorrow's Ashes* (the first album with Kowalski) marked the dramatic shift toward thrash-influenced heaviness. Provides secondary vocals (credited as "The Rod" on *Supporting Caste*). Also designed the cover art for *Failed States*.
- **Significance:** Samolesky said of the lineup change: "I think this record is the closest to what we try to idealize, given the convenience of Todd now being in the band and having him be closer to both mine and Chris's musical and cultural interests."

### Sulynn Hago — Guitar, Vocals (2015–present)

- **From:** Puerto Rico (moved to Florida at age 9, grew up in Tampa, later relocated to Brooklyn, NY)
- **Pronouns:** They/them
- **Joined:** 2015, initially as touring guitarist; credited as full band member starting with *Victory Lap* (2017)
- **How they joined:** Selected from approximately 400 applicants after a friend jokingly tagged them in the job posting. Hago submitted three audition videos playing "Night Letters," "Status Update," and "Note to Self" — technically demanding songs learned quickly. Had been a Propagandhi fan since age 13 (around 2000-2001).
- **Background:** Tampa punk/metal scene — played in Ink and Sweat, New Bruises, Feral Babies, and Career. Feral Babies won Creative Loafing's Best of the Bay Awards for "Best Local Punk Act" and "Best Local Metal/Hardcore" (2012).
- **Guitar setup:** Gibson SG through Fractal Audio and Marshall JCM800 for Propagandhi. Strymon TimeLine and Strymon Flint pedals, Boss DD-3 in a Crocodile Tail Loop switcher. For other projects, plays Fender guitars including a Strat and Johnny Marr Jaguar.
- **Musical range:** Classical and jazz guitar training in addition to punk and metal. Teaches online masterclasses through Julian Lage's Guitar.Study platform (2020). Performs with the Chris Cochrane trio in New York. Joined Chicago-based hardcore band La Armada for shows in 2023.
- **Impact:** Brought additional melodic dimension and counterpoint guitar work. Hannah noted that having a second guitarist who could play atmospheric counterpoint parts gave the band "more dimension and depth."

### Former Members

- **John K. Samson** — Bass, Vocals (1991–1997). Departed after *Less Talk, More Rock* to form The Weakerthans, one of Canada's most acclaimed indie rock bands. The split was amicable but driven by creative differences — Samson's songwriting didn't fit Propagandhi's increasingly overt political approach. Samson himself said: "I was writing songs at the time, and there wasn't really room for them in that band. And there shouldn't have been." Hannah and Samolesky's G7 Welcoming Committee label released The Weakerthans' first two albums.
- **David "The Beaver" Guillas** — Guitar, Vocals (2006–2015). Second guitarist on *Supporting Caste* (2009) and *Failed States* (2012). Contributed additional guitar parts to *Victory Lap* (2017) as a "Propagandhi alumnus." Hannah described Guillas's role as playing "counterpoint parts that added ambiance and atmosphere."
- **Scott Hopper** — Bass, Vocals (1986–1989). Original bassist.
- **Mike Braumeister** — Bass (1989–1991). Second bassist. Moved to Vancouver, prompting John K. Samson's recruitment.

## Albums

### How to Clean Everything (1993)

- **Label:** Fat Wreck Chords
- **Recorded:** February 1993 at Westbeach Recorders, Hollywood, California
- **Produced by:** Fat Mike (NOFX)
- **Lineup:** Chris Hannah, John K. Samson, Jord Samolesky (three-piece)
- **17 tracks, ~34 minutes** (tracks 13-17 consist of various voices saying "Fuck"; track 12 is a cover of Cheap Trick's "I Want You to Want Me")
- **Sound:** Fast, catchy skate punk with ska and reggae elements. Politically charged but melodically accessible — a classic Fat Wreck Chords debut. Fat Mike excised three songs from the initial recordings to tighten the album.
- **Key tracks:** "Anti-Manifesto" (album opener, statement of intent), "Ska Sucks" (tongue-in-cheek; became an ironic anthem), "Haille Sellasse, Up Your Ass," "Head? Chest? or Foot?"
- **Context:** The band was signed after opening for NOFX in 1992 and covering Cheap Trick's "I Want You to Want Me." Fat Mike was impressed by their performance and pointed politics.
- **Reception:** *The Fresno Bee* (1995) deemed it the best album released by Fat Wreck Chords. AllMusic called it "Anarchy 101 to a mass audience."
- **Reissue:** 2013 reissue on Fat Wreck added bonus tracks "Pigs Will Pay," "Homophobes Are Just Mad Cause They Can't Get Laid," "Leg-Hold Trap," plus four original demos.
- **Note:** Hannah has said he "kind of hates" this album in retrospect — not for its politics, but because it doesn't reflect the heavier, more technically accomplished band Propagandhi became.

### Less Talk, More Rock (1996)

- **Label:** Fat Wreck Chords
- **Lineup:** Chris Hannah, John K. Samson, Jord Samolesky
- **Sound:** Intensified aggression over the debut — tighter riffs, more confrontational delivery. Early progression from pop-punk accessibility toward harder-edged punk. The title itself is a mission statement.
- **Key tracks:** "...And We Thought Nation-States Were a Bad Idea" (one of their most iconic tracks; appeared in different form on the Fat Wreck compilation *Survival of the Fattest*), "Nailing Descartes to the Wall/(Liquid) Meat Is Still Murder," "The Only Good Fascist is a Dead Fascist," "Apparently, I'm a 'P.C. Fascist' (Because I Care About Both Human and Non-Human Animals)"
- **Controversy:** The album's pro-feminism and "gay positive" stance caused controversy in some punk circles — which was entirely the point.
- **Significance:** Last album with John K. Samson. After its release, Samson departed and formed The Weakerthans. The end of the "classic" Propagandhi lineup and the beginning of the band's transformation.

### Today's Empires, Tomorrow's Ashes (2001)

- **Label:** G7 Welcoming Committee Records (Canada) / Fat Wreck Chords (international)
- **Released:** February 6, 2001
- **Lineup:** Chris Hannah, Todd Kowalski, Jord Samolesky
- **Sound:** A seismic shift. Fans expecting another skate punk album were confronted with an insane blend of melodic hardcore and thrash-metal technicality. Kowalski's aggressive songwriting and increased density of guitar lines transformed the band. This album is the first building block of the sound that became more dense, more technical, and more outwardly indebted to the thrash metal bands (Venom, Metallica, Slayer, Exodus, Sacrifice, Voivod) that caused Hannah to pick up a guitar in the first place.
- **Key tracks:** "Back to the Motor League" (critique of punk scene conformity; references Dead Kennedys' "Triumph of the Swill" and "Chickenshit Conformist"; one of their most beloved tracks), "Fuck the Border," "Today's Empires, Tomorrow's Ashes"
- **Significance:** The pivot point. Everything before this is "early Propagandhi"; everything after builds on what this album established.

### Potemkin City Limits (2005)

- **Label:** G7 Welcoming Committee Records
- **Released:** October 18, 2005
- **Sound:** Continued the trajectory of *Today's Empires* — incorporating thrash metal riffs, progressive complexities, and technical guitar interplay. Evolution from straightforward punk velocity to multifaceted songwriting with heavier, more demanding arrangements.
- **Key tracks:** "A Speculative Fiction" (opening track; won the 2006 SOCAN Songwriting Prize by online vote — a remarkable achievement for a punk band on an independent label), "Iteration," "Die Jugend Marschiert"
- **Significance:** Pivotal shift album. The thrash-punk fusion fully crystallized. Title references the "Potemkin village" — a facade constructed to deceive, fitting the band's political concerns.

### Supporting Caste (2009)

- **Label:** G7 Welcoming Committee Records / Smallman Records (North America), Hassle Records (UK/Europe), Grand Hotel van Cleef (Germany)
- **Released:** March 10, 2009
- **Recorded:** Fall 2008 at Blasting Room Studios (Fort Collins, CO) and Illegal Combatant Studios (Winnipeg, MB)
- **Lineup:** Chris Hannah, Todd Kowalski, Jord Samolesky, David Guillas (first album)
- **16 tracks**
- **Sound:** The addition of Guillas as second guitarist gave the band more dimension — counterpoint parts, ambient textures, atmospheric depth layered over the thrash-punk foundation. Blended melodic hardcore with intricate guitar work. First Propagandhi album not released on Fat Wreck Chords.
- **Key tracks:** "Night Letters" (became a live staple; themes of displacement and political violence), "Supporting Caste," "Human(e) Meat (The Flensing of Sandor Katz)"
- **Vocals credited as:** "Jesus H. Chris" (Hannah) and "The Rod" (Kowalski)

### Failed States (2012)

- **Label:** Epitaph Records
- **Released:** September 4, 2012
- **Produced/mixed by:** John Paul Peters
- **Mastered by:** Troy Glessner
- **Lineup:** Chris Hannah, Todd Kowalski, Jord Samolesky, David Guillas
- **Sound:** Even more ferocious than *Supporting Caste*. Full-on prog-thrash with no apology — "beats the listener over the head for the entire 37 minutes without mercy." Mid-tempo grooves explode into speedy, metal-influenced riffing. Some of the most technically demanding playing in the band's catalog.
- **Key tracks:** "Note to Self" (six-minute opening opus introducing all major album themes), "Status Update" (shredding riffs), "Duplicate Keys Icaro — an Interim Report" (mid-tempo groove into metal blowout), "Things I Like" (throwback to *Less Talk, More Rock* energy)
- **Chart:** #1 Billboard Heatseekers, #107 Billboard 200 (3,500 first-week sales)
- **Note:** Hannah later felt the original mix sounded inferior to *Supporting Caste* and *Victory Lap*. A remastered version was released on streaming services February 1, 2019.
- **Significance:** First album on Epitaph. G7 Welcoming Committee closed around this time. Last album with David Guillas as a full member.

### Victory Lap (2017)

- **Label:** Epitaph Records
- **Released:** September 29, 2017
- **Lineup:** Chris Hannah, Todd Kowalski, Jord Samolesky, Sulynn Hago (first album as full member; David Guillas contributed additional guitar parts as "Propagandhi alumnus")
- **Sound:** The culmination of their thrash-punk evolution. "The most thrash metal Propagandhi track" (the title track). Dense, technically demanding, lyrically complex. Hannah adopted a new writing philosophy: "First thing out of my mouth is the first thing that goes on the paper" — aiming for rawer, more immediate lyrics.
- **Key tracks:** "Victory Lap" (mentions roadside bombs in Kandahar and Ayn Rand's Invisible Hand; one of their heaviest moments), "Comply/Resist," "Failed Imagineer," "Cop Just Out of Frame"
- **Critical reception:** Widely praised. Critics noted the transformation "from a skate punk band with above average political intelligence but fairly literal lyrics, into a dark thrash/punk band with complexly poetic and politically radical lyrics, sprinkled with a dose of humor." One reviewer summed up the sound: "Propagandhi = Iron Maiden + Descendents + Rush."
- **Significance:** First album with Hago as full member. Considered by many their finest work — the point where technical ambition, political fury, and songwriting maturity converged.

### At Peace (2025)

- **Label:** Epitaph Records
- **Released:** May 2, 2025
- **Mixed by:** Jason Livermore at Blasting Room Studios (December 2024)
- **Lineup:** Chris Hannah, Todd Kowalski, Jord Samolesky, Sulynn Hago
- **13 tracks, 47 minutes**
- **Sound:** First album in eight years. Features some of their most experimental compositions — prog-metal ballads, slowed-down hard rock alongside skate-punk, thrash, and melodic hardcore. Hannah likened it to "a cross between Judas Priest and SNFU." More reflective approach tempered with an undercurrent of unease.
- **Themes:** "The existential dread of eking out a life worth living in this completely failed society." Forged during the political climate of late 2024. A plea for hope against hopelessness.
- **Key tracks:** "Guiding Lights," "At Peace," "Cat Guy," "No Longer Young," "Benito's Earlier Work," "Vampires Are Real"
- **Tour:** "RECONSTRUCTION TOUR 2025" with Pennywise, Comeback Kid, The Iron Roses, and Dead Pioneers (Europe, May 2025)

## Musical Analysis — What Makes Propagandhi Sound Like Propagandhi

### Guitar — Chris Hannah

Hannah's guitar work is the engine of Propagandhi's sound. His playing draws equally from thrash metal (Kreator, Slayer, Voivod) and melodic punk (Bad Religion, Descendents), creating a style that is technically demanding but never gratuitously showy. Drop C# tuning with heavy strings (.011-.052) gives a thick, aggressive tone through the modded Gibson SG. Riffs are intricate and composed rather than improvised — every part serves the song's architecture. Hannah's leads are melodic and purposeful, influenced more by NWOBHM and thrash than by punk's typical simplicity.

### Guitar — Sulynn Hago (2015+)

Hago's addition transformed Propagandhi from a power trio with occasional second guitar into a genuine dual-guitar band. Their classical and jazz training brings counterpoint, atmosphere, and textural depth that Hannah's thrash-rooted playing doesn't naturally produce. The interplay between Hannah's aggressive riffing and Hago's more nuanced, effects-laden parts (Strymon pedals, varied guitar voicings) creates a layered, dynamic sound.

### Bass — Todd Kowalski

Kowalski's bass is not a background instrument. His grindcore background (Swallowing Shit) brought aggression and density to Propagandhi's low end. He is a co-principal songwriter, and his compositions tend toward the heavier, more relentless end of the band's spectrum. Provides secondary vocals that add urgency and variety.

### Drums — Jord Samolesky

Samolesky navigates constant tempo changes, time signature shifts, and stylistic pivots with precision. His playing spans skate punk speed, thrash double-time, blast beats, and progressive odd-time passages — often within a single song. The drumming is technically demanding but always serves the song rather than drawing attention to itself.

### Vocals

Hannah's vocal delivery is distinctive — an aggressive, nasal punk bark that retains genuine melodic sensibility. He can shift from strained shouting to clean singing within a phrase. The lyrics are delivered with conviction and clarity; given their complexity and density, this clarity is essential. Kowalski's secondary vocals add variety and intensity.

### Song Structure

Propagandhi songs are architecturally complex. They do not follow simple verse-chorus-verse patterns. Songs regularly incorporate multiple tempo changes, key shifts, dynamic contrasts (quiet passages exploding into thrash), and extended instrumental sections. A single track might move through melodic punk, thrash metal, progressive rock, and back. This structural ambition increased steadily from *Today's Empires* onward, reaching its apex on *Victory Lap* and *At Peace*.

### Lyrical Approach

The lyrics demand engagement. Propagandhi's writing is dense, allusive, and intellectually rigorous — critics have noted that reading the lyric sheet requires "a dictionary and an open Wikipedia tab." References span political theory, philosophy, history, current events, and personal confession. The band does not simplify for accessibility. Despite this density, the best Propagandhi lyrics maintain emotional directness — fury, despair, dark humor, and occasional tenderness coexist with the intellectual content.

### The Evolution

The key to understanding Propagandhi's sound is that it was always heading toward thrash metal. Hannah wanted to play Kreator and Voivod from the start but lacked the technical ability in 1986. As the band improved, they progressively incorporated the thrash, progressive, and metal elements Hannah had always wanted. The skate punk of *How to Clean Everything* was not the "real" Propagandhi — it was what they could play at the time. The thrash-punk of *Victory Lap* is closer to the band Hannah envisioned as a teenager.

### Cited Influences

**Metal:** Kreator, Voivod, Celtic Frost, Sacrifice, Venom, Metallica, Slayer, Exodus, Death, Sepultura, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden
**Punk/Hardcore:** Bad Religion, Dead Kennedys, COC, SNFU, Descendents, Fugazi, Subhumans, Crass
**Other:** Rush (structural ambition), Motorhead (the punk-metal bridge)

## Lyrical Themes

### Anti-Capitalism and Anarchism

The foundational political position. Propagandhi's anarchism is not vague anti-authoritarianism but a developed, articulate critique drawing on political theory (participatory economics, anarcho-syndicalism). The G7 Welcoming Committee label was structured as a practical implementation of these ideas.

### Anti-Imperialism and Anti-Nationalism

"...And We Thought Nation-States Were a Bad Idea" is not just a song title but a thesis statement. The band consistently critiques imperialism, militarism, border enforcement, and nationalist ideology. *Today's Empires, Tomorrow's Ashes* addresses the cyclical nature of imperial power.

### Animal Rights and Veganism

Not an afterthought. The band members are committed vegans, and animal rights are treated with the same intellectual seriousness as human rights. "Nailing Descartes to the Wall/(Liquid) Meat Is Still Murder" connects animal exploitation to broader systems of domination.

### Anti-Homophobia and Feminism

Propagandhi has been explicitly "gay positive" and pro-feminist since the early 1990s — a position that was genuinely controversial in the punk scene at the time. *Less Talk, More Rock* faced backlash for these stances, which the band welcomed as proof the message was needed.

### Scene Critique

"Back to the Motor League" and other tracks critique punk's own hypocrisy — conformity masquerading as rebellion, political posturing without action, macho culture within supposedly progressive spaces.

### Existential and Personal

Later albums (especially *At Peace*) incorporate more personal themes — aging, despair, the challenge of maintaining hope and purpose in a world that seems irredeemable. Hannah: "What we're putting into the songs now probably reflects more despair than 30 years ago."

## G7 Welcoming Committee Records

- **Founded by:** Chris Hannah and Jord Samolesky
- **Startup funding:** $50,000 loan from Fat Mike (NOFX/Fat Wreck Chords), recouped within months
- **Structure:** Worker-owned collective based on participatory economics (the model proposed by Robin Hahnel and Michael Albert)
- **Key releases:** The Weakerthans' first two albums, Propagandhi's own *Today's Empires, Tomorrow's Ashes* and *Potemkin City Limits*, plus nearly 60 other albums and publications
- **Closed:** Around 2012
- **Significance:** A genuine attempt to build an alternative economic model within the music industry, not just a vanity label

---

## Legacy and Influence

**Who they influenced:** The thrash-punk crossover that Propagandhi pioneered influenced bands across punk and metal. Their willingness to get heavier and more technical without abandoning punk's ethos showed that the genres were not mutually exclusive. Bands like Comeback Kid (fellow Winnipeg punks), A Wilhelm Scream, Strike Anywhere, and countless melodic hardcore bands cite Propagandhi's influence.

**Role in 90s Fat Wreck Chords scene:** One of the label's most important early signings alongside Lagwagon and No Use for a Name. Their departure to G7 and then Epitaph mirrored their musical departure from the Fat Wreck skate punk template.

**The Weakerthans connection:** John K. Samson's departure from Propagandhi to form The Weakerthans is one of punk's most productive splits — both bands thrived creatively after the separation, and Hannah's label released The Weakerthans' early work.

**Political credibility:** Propagandhi's politics are taken seriously because they are practiced, not just performed. The G7 Welcoming Committee's economic structure, the band's activism, their veganism, and their consistency over decades give their political lyrics an authenticity that few punk bands can match.

**SOCAN Songwriting Prize:** "A Speculative Fiction" winning the 2006 SOCAN Songwriting Prize (Canada's major songwriting award) by public vote demonstrated that Propagandhi's audience extends beyond punk into broader musical culture.

**Longevity:** Still active and releasing critically acclaimed music after nearly 40 years. *At Peace* (2025) was their first album in eight years but showed no creative decline.

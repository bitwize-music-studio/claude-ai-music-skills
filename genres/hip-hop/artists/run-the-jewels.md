# Run the Jewels — Deep Dive

## Overview

Run the Jewels (RTJ) is an American hip-hop superduo composed of Atlanta rapper Killer Mike (Michael Santiago Render) and Brooklyn rapper-producer El-P (Jaime Meline). Formed in 2013 after a chance introduction by Adult Swim/Cartoon Network executive Jason DeMarco in 2011, the duo emerged from opposite ends of hip-hop's geographic and stylistic spectrum — Killer Mike from the Southern trap and OutKast lineage, El-P from New York's underground and experimental scene — and fused those traditions into one of the most critically acclaimed and politically potent acts of the 2010s and 2020s.

Their origin story is rooted in mutual respect. DeMarco brokered the introduction knowing both artists admired each other's work. The chemistry was immediate: El-P produced Killer Mike's 2012 album *R.A.P. Music* in its entirety, while Mike appeared on El-P's *Cancer 4 Cure* track "Tougher Colder Killer." Both albums dropped within weeks of each other in May 2012, and the subsequent "Into the Wild" tour sold out across the country. Inspired by legendary two-man outfits they adored — EPMD, UGK, OutKast — they decided to form a permanent duo. El-P originally intended "Run the Jewels" as the title of his next solo album; the name was inspired by a line in LL Cool J's "Cheesy Rat Blues," casting them as scrappy stickup kids poised to mug the mainstream.

Every RTJ album has been released as a free digital download — a deliberate rejection of industry gatekeeping that built massive grassroots loyalty. Their self-titled debut (2013) on Fool's Gold Records established the formula: industrial production, rapid-fire lyrical exchanges, and a mix of braggadocio, dark humor, and political fury. Each subsequent album expanded the sonic palette and deepened the political engagement, culminating in *RTJ4* (2020), which debuted in the Billboard Top 10 and became an unofficial soundtrack to the George Floyd protests and Black Lives Matter movement. The duo has been described as "hip-hop's most intense truth-tellers" and "a brash, '90s-nodding antidote to a post-Drake era of introspective MCs."

Beyond music, both members are deeply engaged in activism and entrepreneurship. Killer Mike is a prominent political voice who campaigned for Bernie Sanders in 2016 and 2020, runs a barbershop in Atlanta, and co-founded Greenwood, a digital bank serving Black and Latino communities. El-P rebuilt his career from the ashes of Definitive Jux's closure, channeling two decades of underground credibility into RTJ's mainstream breakthrough. Together, they have performed at Coachella, Glastonbury, Lollapalooza, and Madison Square Garden, and their music has been featured in Marvel's *Black Panther* trailer and Edgar Wright's *Baby Driver*.

## Members

### Killer Mike (Michael Santiago Render)

- **Born:** April 20, 1975, Atlanta, Georgia
- **Origin:** Atlanta — grew up in a politically active household; attended Frederick Douglass High School (graduated 1993)
- **Education:** Briefly attended Morehouse College (historically Black men's institution), facilitated by civil rights figure Andrew Young; dropped out after roughly one year to pursue music
- **RTJ role:** Rapper, lyricist, public spokesperson

**Solo Career:**

Killer Mike's recording debut came as a feature on OutKast's *Stankonia* (2000), appearing on "Snappin' & Trappin'." His verse on their 2001 single "The Whole World" won the 2002 Grammy for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. He signed to Big Boi's Purple Ribbon Records and Columbia for his debut album *Monster* (2003), which peaked at #10 on the Billboard 200. After leaving Columbia, he released the independently-minded *I Pledge Allegiance to the Grind* series (2006, 2008), then signed with T.I.'s Grand Hustle for *PL3DGE* (2011). The pivotal shift came with *R.A.P. Music* (2012), produced entirely by El-P on Williams Street Records — the album that catalyzed Run the Jewels.

In 2023, he released his sixth solo album *Michael* on Loma Vista Recordings, which won three Grammy Awards at the 66th ceremony, including Best Rap Album. In 2024, he released *Songs for Sinners & Saints* with his gospel group Michael & The Mighty Midnight Revival.

**Style:** Commanding baritone delivery, Southern cadence, controlled swagger. Mike storms verses with a pit-bull intensity — equal parts hilarious and hostile. His lyrics draw from lived experience in Atlanta, weaving street-level observation with systemic political critique. He connects personal narrative to structural analysis: school-to-prison pipelines, police brutality, economic inequality, Black community empowerment.

**Activism & Entrepreneurship:**
- Vocal supporter of Bernie Sanders (2016, 2020 presidential campaigns)
- Netflix docuseries *Trigger Warning with Killer Mike* (2019) — six episodes investigating social issues affecting Black Americans
- PBS interview program *Love & Respect* (2021-present) — won an Emmy Award in 2022
- Co-founded Greenwood Bank (2020) with Bounce TV founder Ryan Glover and Andrew Young — a Black-owned digital bank for underserved communities
- Co-owns Graffitis SWAG barbershop in Atlanta (founded 2001)
- Featured speaker in MIT's Hip Hop Speaker Series on "Race Relations in the US"
- Second Amendment advocate who has spoken across political lines on gun rights
- After the Ferguson grand jury decision, while other acts cancelled performances in protest, RTJ took the stage and rallied the crowd through tears in support of racial unity

**Film/TV:** Appearances in *Idlewild*, *ATL*, *Baby Driver*, and *America: The Motion Picture*

### El-P (Jaime Meline)

- **Born:** March 2, 1975, Brooklyn, New York City
- **Origin:** Brooklyn — son of jazz pianist Harry Meline (who performed as Harry Keyes)
- **Education:** Expelled from several schools for problems with authority; pursued music full-time as a teenager
- **RTJ role:** Rapper, sole producer, sonic architect

**Pre-RTJ Career:**

At 17, El-P met DJ Mr. Len at his birthday party and they formed Company Flow in 1992 alongside rapper Bigg Jus. Their debut album *Funcrusher Plus* (1997, Rawkus Records) is considered a cornerstone of underground hip-hop — dense, claustrophobic production paired with labyrinthine lyricism that rejected mainstream conventions. After disputes with Rawkus, El-P founded Definitive Jux (Def Jux) in 1999, building it into the premier underground hip-hop label of the early 2000s. He produced Cannibal Ox's *The Cold Vein* (2001), widely regarded as one of the greatest underground hip-hop albums ever made, and released landmark projects from Aesop Rock (*Labor Days*), Cage, Mr. Lif, and others.

His solo career unfolded in five-year intervals: *Fantastic Damage* (2002) — a blitzkrieg debut powered by Bomb Squad-style wall-of-sound production with a sci-fi aura; *I'll Sleep When You're Dead* (2007) — featuring Trent Reznor, the Mars Volta, Cat Power, and Aesop Rock, peaking at #78 on the Billboard 200; and *Cancer 4 Cure* (2012, Fat Possum) — dedicated to his late friend Camu Tao, who died of lung cancer. In 2004, he also recorded *High Water* with the Blue Series Continuum, a jazz-fusion album that received favorable reviews from both hip-hop and jazz critics.

After mounting economic pressures from digital disruption, El-P announced Definitive Jux's indefinite hiatus in February 2010. Two years later, his collaboration with Killer Mike would resurrect his career on an entirely new scale.

**Production Style:** El-P's sonic identity is built on industrial abrasion, sci-fi futurism, and relentless rhythmic complexity. His production draws from the Bomb Squad (Public Enemy), Art of Noise, Nine Inch Nails, Steve Reich, John Carpenter film scores, Gary Numan, and Devo. Early career work was built on an Akai MPC sampler; over time he moved to computer-based production, collecting analog synthesizers and outboard gear. For RTJ3, he acquired a Yamaha CS-80 — "the synth that Vangelis used for Blade Runner" — whose cosmic textures permeate that album. His approach has been described as "two parts industrial noise, one part '80s rap reference, one part modern swing" — or more evocatively, "a boom-bap Vangelis."

## Musical Analysis

### Production Style

El-P is the sole producer of every Run the Jewels album, giving the project a singular sonic vision. His production aesthetic fuses industrial noise, sci-fi synthesizers, and frenetic percussion into what one critic called "a boom-bap Vangelis." The sonic palette is built from several core elements:

**Drums and Rhythm:** Booming kicks, cracking snares, and complex polyrhythmic patterns form the backbone. The drum programming draws from classic boom-bap but runs it through an industrial filter — machine-gun hi-hats, metallic percussion hits, distorted 808s. Rhythms are often asymmetric and unpredictable, creating a sense of controlled chaos that keeps listeners off-balance.

**Synthesizers and Texture:** El-P layers analog synthesizers — including the Yamaha CS-80 (RTJ3 onward), vintage Moogs, and various modular gear — into dense, claustrophobic soundscapes. The synth work ranges from ominous low-end drones and alarm-siren leads to eerie, atmospheric pads that evoke dystopian cityscapes. There is a cinematic quality influenced by John Carpenter film scores and Vangelis's *Blade Runner* soundtrack.

**Bass and Low End:** RTJ tracks are defined by aggressive, speaker-rattling bass. Sub-bass frequencies dominate the low end, creating a physical, chest-punching impact. The bass is often distorted or processed through effects chains that give it an abrasive, industrial character.

**Sampling and Texture:** While El-P's early work was heavily sample-based (Akai MPC), the RTJ productions blend sampling with original synthesizer work and live instrumentation. Samples from sources like Gang of Four and The Soul Searchers appear alongside original compositions. Field recordings, feedback loops, and industrial sound design add textural depth.

**Influences:** The production openly channels the Bomb Squad (Public Enemy), Nine Inch Nails, Art of Noise, Steve Reich's minimalism, and Gary Numan's synth-pop — filtered through two decades of underground hip-hop experimentation.

### Vocal Interplay

The RTJ formula depends on the complementary contrast between two radically different MCs:

**Killer Mike** brings a deep, commanding baritone rooted in Southern hip-hop tradition. His delivery is aggressive but controlled — a "pit bull lyrical delivery" that alternates between controlled swagger and volcanic fury. He tends toward direct, declarative statements that land like punches. His Atlanta roots give his flow a Southern cadence and rhythmic bounce that contrasts with El-P's more staccato approach.

**El-P** delivers dense, slippery verses full of black humor and bleak observation. His flow is more technically intricate — internal rhymes, multi-syllabic patterns, and rapid-fire delivery that packs maximum information into every bar. Where Mike hits with a sledgehammer, El-P cuts with a scalpel. His dry, sarcastic sneer provides sardonic counterpoint to Mike's impassioned directness.

**The Exchange:** RTJ tracks typically alternate verses between the two rather than using traditional verse-chorus structures. They build momentum through escalation — each MC pushing the other to go harder, be funnier, get angrier. The effect is conversational but competitive, like two friends trying to top each other's best lines. This back-and-forth creates a relentless energy that rarely lets up across an entire album.

**Contrast as Strength:** A Black Southern rapper and a white Northern producer-rapper from completely different hip-hop traditions — their partnership transcends geography, race, and scene boundaries. Killer Mike provides emotional directness and lived-experience authority on racial politics; El-P provides conceptual abstraction and sonic dystopia. Together, they cover more ground than either could alone.

### Political Documentary Content

Run the Jewels operates as political documentary hip-hop in the tradition of Public Enemy, but updated for the surveillance state, mass incarceration, and post-Ferguson America. Their political content targets several interlocking systems:

**Police Brutality and State Violence:** The most visceral and recurring theme. "Close Your Eyes (And Count to Fuck)" (RTJ2) with Zack de la Rocha is an anthem of rage against police violence, accompanied by a music video depicting a Black youth and a police officer locked in combat. "Walking in the Snow" (RTJ4) became prophetically devastating — Killer Mike's bars about a man begging "I can't breathe" were recorded months before George Floyd's murder in the exact same manner. The track connects individual police killings to systemic racism: from lowered expectations in elementary school to brutality on the streets.

**Economic Inequality and Capitalism:** "JU$T" (RTJ4) featuring Pharrell and Zack de la Rocha deconstructs ties between capitalism, poverty, and modern-day slavery. "Lie, Cheat, Steal" (RTJ2) frames systemic corruption as the operating logic of American power structures. The duo consistently frames economic exploitation as inseparable from racial oppression.

**Surveillance State and Government Overreach:** El-P's dystopian production aesthetic reinforces lyrical themes about government surveillance, militarized policing, and the erosion of civil liberties. The albums paint America as a corporate police state where citizens are monitored, manipulated, and disposable.

**Education and the Prison Pipeline:** Killer Mike draws direct lines between underfunded schools, standardized testing, and mass incarceration — framing the school-to-prison pipeline as deliberate policy rather than failure.

**Approach:** RTJ's political messaging avoids didacticism by embedding it within visceral, emotionally immediate music. They do not lecture — they rage, joke, and tell stories. The political content lands because it is grounded in personal experience (Mike's encounters with police, El-P's experience with institutional authority) rather than abstract ideology. As Mike has emphasized: "I just want us to keep doing dope records first of all and to be important because we make dope music."

### Humor & Personality

The secret weapon of Run the Jewels is their refusal to be solemn. For every devastating political indictment, there is an outrageous punchline, a juvenile sex joke, or a moment of pure braggadocio absurdity. Their official bio describes their core tenets as "gymnastic displays of skills, incendiary political rhetoric, furious scratch solos, merciless braggadocio, battle-honed assholery, R-rated punchlines."

**Braggadocio as Vehicle:** Many RTJ tracks begin as pure flex — two veteran MCs proving they can out-rap anyone alive — before pivoting into political commentary without warning. "Lie, Cheat, Steal" opens like gleeful lyrical larceny before warping into a dissection of institutional corruption. This tonal whiplash is deliberate: it keeps listeners engaged through entertainment before delivering the message.

**Complementary Comedy:** Mike's humor is broad, warm, and Southern — earthy metaphors, trash-talk, and self-deprecating swagger. El-P's humor is darker, more sardonic — dry wit, absurdist imagery, and deadpan delivery. Together, they create a comedic dynamic that feels like watching two best friends roast each other and the world simultaneously.

**The Balance:** RTJ3 was described as "a thesis on their politics, brimming with the sarcasm and humor that colors their wit and socio-political consciousness." The duo's ability to be simultaneously "hilarious and hostile" is what distinguishes them from purely political hip-hop acts — they never sacrifice entertainment for message, or vice versa.

### Evolution Across Albums

**RTJ1 (2013) — The Introduction:** Primarily braggadocio and creative wordplay with flashes of social consciousness. El-P's production is raw and stripped-down — industrial clanks, minimal hooks, aggressive bass. The album establishes the duo's chemistry and proves the concept works. Standout: "A Christmas Fucking Miracle" reveals unexpected emotional vulnerability.

**RTJ2 (2014) — The Leap:** A massive jump in quality. Production becomes more layered and memorable; lyrics pivot toward sustained social commentary, catalyzed by the Ferguson shooting and Eric Garner's death. Features expand the sound (Zack de la Rocha, Travis Barker). The debut of RTJ as a political force, not just a rap duo. "Close Your Eyes (And Count to Fuck)" and "Early" confront police brutality head-on with accompanying videos.

**RTJ3 (2016) — The Expansion:** The most sonically ambitious album. El-P's CS-80 synthesizer brings eerie, expansive textures influenced by *The Cold Vein*-era production. Political engagement deepens in the context of the 2016 election and Black Lives Matter. Features become more eclectic (Kamasi Washington's jazz saxophone, Tunde Adebimpe's art-rock vocals, Danny Brown's manic energy). "Legend Has It" becomes their biggest mainstream crossover via the *Black Panther* trailer.

**RTJ4 (2020) — The Culmination:** Their most focused and urgent album. Released two days early amid the George Floyd protests, it captured a moment of national reckoning. Production incorporates dancehall, Rick Rubin-style minimalism, and old-school block-party elements alongside the signature industrial sound. "Walking in the Snow" and "JU$T" are their most devastating political statements. Features are curated for maximum impact: Mavis Staples brings generational civil rights gravitas, Josh Homme adds rock guitar fury, Pharrell adds pop accessibility to radical content. NME's five-star review called it "protest music for a new generation."

**Overall Arc:** Each album shifted the ratio further from pure braggadocio toward political engagement while simultaneously expanding the sonic palette. The production grew more textured and dynamic; the lyrics grew more targeted and urgent. But the duo never abandoned the humor, the competitive energy, or the sheer fun of two elite MCs trading bars.

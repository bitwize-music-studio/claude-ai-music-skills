# Brock Berrigan — Deep Dive

## Overview

Brock Berrigan is the alias of a musician, producer, and multi-instrumentalist who describes himself as a "beat maker, music enthusiast, multi instrumentalist, sample hunter." Originally based in Astoria, Queens, New York, he relocated to southern Utah around 2023 and has been making music from the desert ever since. He is known for performing and appearing in press photos wearing a rooster/chicken mask — a persona discovered at a friend's house the morning after a Halloween party — paired with a suit and cigarette, cultivating anonymity over celebrity.

Berrigan began recording music at age 13, initially playing guitar and touring the East Coast in a punk band (around 1999). He spent his teenage years and early twenties as a "scruffy metalhead," producing full albums of what he describes as "Mastodon-esque symphonies of shred." His transition to hip-hop beat-making began in the early 2010s, and he quickly amassed a massive catalog. Over the course of his career, he has released 32+ projects on Bandcamp — albums, EPs, and singles — totaling over 150 released tracks, with an estimated 1,000+ cutting-room-floor experiments that never made final cuts.

His sound sits at the intersection of boom-bap, jazz-infused instrumental hip-hop, trip-hop, and lo-fi beats. He chops and rearranges samples from jazz, soul, funk, and Latin records, layering them with live instrumentation (guitar, bass, drums) and field recordings. His work is characterized by a laid-back, groovy aesthetic — warm, richly textured productions that reward both active listening and background ambiance. Each album typically features short, compact tracks (most under 3 minutes) that function as vignettes — self-contained sonic snapshots.

Berrigan's visual identity is handled by longtime collaborator Robert Deitmaring (photographer, friend since high school) and Ian Klarer (artwork/animation). His albums are consistently mastered by Birocratic, a fellow producer. He has been featured on multiple Chillhop Music compilations and his Point Pleasant (2017) was released through Chillhop Records.

Beat blogs and the SoundCloud community heralded him as a new independent force in the global beat scene. Fellow producer Eloquent noted: "He doesn't seem concerned about what everybody else is doing. So many producers have started to stray away from sampling nowadays, and that makes his stuff more refreshing." DJs with a taste for Madlib and J Dilla pulled Berrigan beats into their mixes, and rappers from around the world laid verses over his instrumentals.

## Equipment and Production

### DAW
- **GarageBand** — His primary production environment. Instruments litter the floor around his desk "like a mechanic's tools, each in the perfect position for him to reach down and grab it without moving his eyes from the screen." His workspace is described as a basement studio with his 10,000th GarageBand arrangement open.

### Hardware
- **Akai MPD 24** — Primary MIDI pad controller, integral to his artistic identity, featured in album covers and promotional photos
- **Korg MicroKORG Synthesizer/Vocoder** — Used for synthesizer textures (demonstrated on "Cruise Control")
- **Guitar** — Multi-instrumentalist; guitar is his original instrument from age 10
- **Bass, drums** — Plays multiple instruments, layering live performances over sampled material

### Production Philosophy
- **Sample hunting** is the core of his creative process; he describes himself as a "sample hunter"
- Spends evenings after his day job hunting samples and listening to music
- Produces nearly every night; his "magical time" is around 2 AM: "there are no other distractions and the music just flows"
- Typical sleep is 4-5 AM during production periods
- Credits his instrumental background with providing advantages in song structure and layering: formal training "definitely helps out the sound. Makes the music much more interesting than just a 4 bar loop"
- Beer (specifically Budweiser) is part of his creative ritual: "Beer really gets me in the groove while recording. While making these songs, I can have the song on loop for hours at a time. So the beer keeps it entertaining and makes me think outside the box. It is also responsible for basically all of the glitches in the beats."
- Field recordings add barely detectable texture to his drums and atmospheres
- Albums inspired by physical landscapes — hiking, canyons, desert drives, national parks

## Musical Analysis — What Makes Brock Berrigan Sound Like Brock Berrigan

### Sampling Approach

The foundation of every Brock Berrigan track is the sample. He digs through jazz, soul, funk, bossa nova, and Latin records, chopping and rearranging fragments into new compositions. His sampling sources include artists like Armando Manzanero (Latin romantic music) and a wide range of obscure jazz and soul records. The samples are not just loops — they are deconstructed and rebuilt with his own instrumentation layered on top.

His approach to sampling is decidedly old-school in philosophy — crate-digging ethos applied in the digital age. Fellow producer Eloquent observed that many producers have "strayed away from sampling nowadays, and that makes his stuff more refreshing." While much of the modern lo-fi and chillhop scene relies on synthesized recreations of jazz textures, Berrigan maintains the direct sample-based tradition of his influences.

### Drums and Rhythm

Classic boom-bap foundation: cracking snare drums on the 2 and 4, punchy kicks, and warm hi-hat patterns. The drums have a vintage quality — not overly compressed or modern-sounding. Field recordings add barely detectable texture to the percussion, creating subtle organic grit. The groove is always laid-back, never rushed, but maintains forward momentum through subtle swing and ghost notes.

### Instrumentation and Layering

Berrigan's multi-instrumentalist background separates him from many beat-makers. He plays guitar, bass, and other instruments, layering live performance over sampled material. This creates richly detailed compositions that feel more organic than purely sample-based or purely synthesized work. His background in punk and metal guitar gives his original instrumental contributions a textural quality that sample-only producers cannot achieve.

### Song Length and Structure

Most Brock Berrigan tracks clock in between 1:00 and 3:00 minutes. They are compact, vignette-style compositions — each one a self-contained mood piece. Albums typically feature 14-17 short tracks rather than 10 longer songs. Opening tracks are often sub-30-second intros (e.g., "Make Yourself at Home" at 0:26, "Opening Remarks" at 0:32, "As the Story Goes" at 0:30), establishing atmosphere before the first full beat drops.

### Mood and Aesthetic

The dominant mood across Berrigan's catalog is warm, relaxed, and inviting — the sonic equivalent of a sunset drive through desert canyons or a late-night whiskey on a rooftop. His track titles reinforce this: "Smooth Sailing," "License to Chill," "Nap in the Grand Canyon," "Edible in a Hot Tub," "Whiskey on a Jetski." There is humor in his world (track titles like "A Minor Case of Serious Brain Damage" and "The Shrooms Have the Upper Hand") but the music itself is rarely comedic — it is warm, contemplative, and effortlessly cool.

### Evolution

His early work (2011-2015) was rawer and more directly boom-bap, with shorter tracks and a grittier sample palette. The mid-career period (2016-2019) saw increasing sophistication — longer compositions, more live instrumentation, field recordings, and the influence of his travels to Utah. From 2020 onward, the desert landscape becomes the dominant muse, with albums explicitly inspired by canyon hikes, mountain climbing, and the American Southwest. Production quality has refined over time (Birocratic's mastering becoming a consistent partnership), but the core aesthetic remains remarkably consistent.

### The Utah Influence

A defining narrative thread across the catalog: Berrigan's relationship with Utah and the American Southwest. Starting with The Narrows (2018, inspired by hiking Utah canyons), through The Scenic Route (2019, created while traveling Utah), Utah (2020, directly named for the state), and culminating in Breaking Bread (2022), A Taste of Everything (2023), and Paradise Canyon (2024) — all made during or inspired by extended stays in the desert. Track names reference specific locations: Zion, Angel's Landing, Monument Valley, Cottonwood Canyon, Bryce, Capitol Reef, Canyonlands, Lee's Ferry, Chimney Rock. He relocated permanently to southern Utah around 2023, calling it "paradise."

### Comparisons and Context

Berrigan exists in a lineage that runs from J Dilla and Nujabes through the modern Chillhop and lo-fi beat scene. His sound is most closely comparable to:

- **Nujabes** — The "godfather of lo-fi hip-hop." Berrigan shares the jazz-sampling, instrumental focus, and contemplative mood, though Berrigan's sound is grittier and more boom-bap oriented.
- **J Dilla** — The MPC virtuoso. Berrigan inherits the off-kilter, soulful sampling approach and compact track structures.
- **Madlib** — The prolific crate-digger. Both share a deep commitment to sampling as art form and high-volume output.
- **Birocratic** — Close collaborator and mastering engineer. Similar aesthetic territory.
- **Philanthrope** — Frequent collaborator. Fellow lo-fi/chillhop producer.
- **FloFilz** — German beat-maker producing jazzy, sample-based, old-school hip-hop.
- **Gramatik** — Jazzy/funky beat producer bridging electronic and hip-hop.
- **saib.** — Lo-fi beat producer; collaborated on Chillhop compilations.
- **L'Indecis, Stan Forebee, Aso, Poldoore** — Chillhop scene peers.

What distinguishes Berrigan from many lo-fi producers is his multi-instrumentalist background, his direct sample-based approach (versus synthesized recreations), and the physical landscape inspiration that gives his work a distinctly American, outdoors-inflected character. While much lo-fi hip-hop aims for bedroom/study ambiance, Berrigan's best work evokes open desert, canyon drives, and wilderness solitude.

## Lyrical Themes

Brock Berrigan's work is almost entirely instrumental — there are no lyrics in the traditional sense. However, his track and album titles create a rich thematic vocabulary:

### Adventure and Travel
Track titles reference specific locations and outdoor activities: "Angel's Landing," "Monument Valley," "Canyonlands," "Zion," "Lee's Ferry," "Chimney Rock," "Capitol Reef," "Bryce," "Cottonwood Canyon," "Lake Powell," "Snow Canyon." These are not generic nature references — they are specific places in Utah and the American Southwest.

### Whiskey, Beer, and Good Times
A persistent, tongue-in-cheek celebration of drinking culture: "Whiskey on a Jetski," "Airport Whiskey," "Wishful Drinking," "Champagne Funk," "Champagne in Utah," "Ten Cent Beer Night," "Shower Beer," "Whiskey on the Rocks," "So Long and Thanks for the Beer," "Deja Brew," "Hook, Line and Drinker."

### Humor and Wordplay
Clever, pun-laden titles: "Writer's Brock," "A Brock and a Hard Place," "Optimist Prime," "Edible Arrangement," "Edible in a Hot Tub," "Hazel Part Five" (recurring character across albums), "Board Game Champion," "The Shrooms Have the Upper Hand."

### Nostalgia and Warmth
"Good Company," "Kindred Spirits," "Feeling Good," "Life Goes On," "Silver Linings," "A Fond Farewell," "Carry On," "This Too Shall Pass."

## Genre Context — Where Brock Berrigan Fits

### The Lo-Fi Hip-Hop / Instrumental Beat Lineage

Brock Berrigan operates within a tradition that traces back to the foundational producers of instrumental hip-hop:

**The Pioneers:**
- **J Dilla** (1974-2006) — The MPC virtuoso who proved beat-making was an art form. Donuts (2006) established the template for compact, soulful instrumental hip-hop.
- **Nujabes** (1974-2010) — The Japanese producer often called the "godfather of lo-fi hip-hop." His Samurai Champloo soundtrack and albums like Metaphorical Music brought jazz-infused hip-hop to global audiences.
- **DJ Premier** — Gang Starr's producer, master of the jazz chop and hard boom-bap drum programming.
- **Madlib** — Prolific crate-digger and sample artist. His sheer volume of output and commitment to sampling as craft most closely mirrors Berrigan's approach.
- **Pete Rock** — Soul-sampling pioneer whose warm, jazz-inflected production helped define the sound Berrigan inherited.

**The Bridge Generation:**
- **Flying Lotus** — Pushed instrumental hip-hop into experimental electronic territory.
- **Gramatik** — Bridged the gap between funky sample-based hip-hop and electronic music.

**The Modern Chillhop/Lo-Fi Scene (Berrigan's Peers):**
- **Chillhop Music** — The label/collective that became the hub for modern instrumental hip-hop. Berrigan has been a featured artist since 2016.
- **Birocratic** — Close collaborator (masters all of Berrigan's albums), fellow producer, similar aesthetic.
- **Philanthrope** — Frequent collaborator, Dutch lo-fi producer.
- **FloFilz** — German beat-maker, jazzy sample-based production.
- **L'Indecis, Stan Forebee, Aso, Poldoore, saib., Flitz&Suppe** — The wider Chillhop community.

**What distinguishes Berrigan within this scene:**
1. **Multi-instrumentalist background** — Most lo-fi producers are primarily sample manipulators or synthesizer players. Berrigan's decade-plus of guitar/bass/drums experience gives his layered productions an organic quality.
2. **Direct sampling tradition** — While much modern chillhop uses synthesized or played recreations of jazz textures, Berrigan maintains the classic crate-digging, sample-chopping tradition.
3. **Punk/metal origins** — His formative years in punk and metal give him an unusual perspective for a lo-fi hip-hop producer. This background may account for the energy and directness in his beats that prevents them from becoming pure ambient wallpaper.
4. **Landscape as muse** — Most lo-fi hip-hop evokes urban or indoor settings (the bedroom, the coffee shop, the rainy window). Berrigan's Utah-era work evokes canyons, desert highways, and mountain trails — a distinctly outdoor, American West aesthetic.
5. **Volume and consistency** — 32+ releases, 150+ tracks, 1,000+ unreleased experiments. This prolific output puts him in the Madlib tier of sheer productivity.
6. **GarageBand** — Working in GarageBand rather than Ableton, FL Studio, or Logic gives his productions a particular character. He has pushed the "entry-level" DAW far beyond what most producers attempt with it.

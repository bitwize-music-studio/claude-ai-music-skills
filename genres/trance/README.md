# Trance

## Genre Overview

Trance is a hypnotic form of electronic dance music characterized by repetitive melodic phrases, driving four-on-the-floor beats (typically 125-150 BPM), and dramatic build-ups and breakdowns. Emerging in the early 1990s, trance combines elements of house, techno, and ambient music to create an immersive, journey-like listening experience. The genre emphasizes emotional crescendos, euphoric melodies, and layered synthesizer arrangements that build tension and release throughout a track's duration.

## Characteristics

- **Instrumentation**: Layered synthesizers, pads, arpeggios, bass lines, electronic drums, occasional live instruments (strings, horns), filtered percussion
- **Vocals**: Often ethereal and atmospheric (when present), commonly female vocals, treated with reverb/delay, melodic phrasing over instrumental sections
- **Production**: Heavy use of automation, filtering, EQ sweeps, delay effects, reverb sends, sidechain compression for pumping effect
- **Energy/Mood**: Euphoric, uplifting, hypnotic, emotional intensity with dynamic contrasts; journey from tension to cathartic release
- **Structure**: Extended intro/build-up (2-4 minutes), main section with recurring hooks, breakdown with stripped-down elements, climactic final section, extended outro

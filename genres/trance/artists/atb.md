# ATB — Deep Dive

## Overview

ATB is the stage name of Andre Tanneberger, a German trance producer and DJ active from 1998 to the present. His 1999 debut single "9PM (Till I Come)" became a worldwide hit — reaching #1 in the UK — and established the Balearic melodic trance template that would define his career: warm, airy productions built around memorable melodic hooks, breathy female vocal textures, and an emphasis on space and restraint that distinguished his work from the maximalist tendencies of mainstream trance.

What makes ATB unique in the trance landscape is subtraction rather than addition. Where most trance producers layer synths until the mix is dense and overwhelming, Tanneberger consistently pulls back — leaving room, letting melodies breathe, creating productions that feel open and atmospheric rather than claustrophobic. His signature sound is built around the Roland JD-990 "meowing guitar" preset — a differential loop-based synthesis patch requiring manual pitch wheel bends that creates the instantly recognizable lead sound of "9PM (Till I Come)." Combined with soft supersaw stacks, generous reverb tails, and breathy female vocal fragments used as textural elements rather than traditional lead vocals, the result is trance that feels like a Balearic sunset rather than a warehouse rave.

Tanneberger's career spans over two decades and numerous albums, evolving from the pure melodic trance of his early work through vocal trance collaborations (notably with Tiff Lacey) to a more pop/rock-influenced hybrid in later releases. Throughout, he has maintained an unusual level of control over his output — self-producing, mixing, and even mastering at his own ATB Digital Mastering facility.

## Members

### Andre Tanneberger — Production, Keyboards, DJ (1998-present)

- **Born:** February 26, 1973, Freiberg, Saxony, Germany
- **Background:** Began producing music on a Commodore Amiga 500 with C-Lab Notator sequencing software — a bedroom setup that produced his earliest tracks. Self-taught producer who developed his craft through experimentation rather than formal training.
- **Current studio:** PreSonus Studio One Professional (DAW), RME Fireface 800 (audio interface), Yamaha NS-10M + Audio Optimum MS8 (monitoring). Also operates ATB Digital Mastering, giving him end-to-end control over his productions from composition through final master.
- **Role:** Sole creative force behind ATB. Handles all production, mixing, arrangement, and mastering. Collaborates with vocalists and occasionally other producers, but the sonic vision is entirely his own.
- **Vocal approach:** In early work, ATB used breathy female vocal fragments as texture — atmospheric elements woven into the production rather than conventional lead vocals. Later albums (particularly the Dedicated/No Silence era with Tiff Lacey) shifted toward full vocal collaborations, though the atmospheric treatment of voice remained consistent.

## Albums

### Movin' Melodies (1999)

- **Released:** 1999
- **Label:** Kontor Records
- **Produced by:** Andre Tanneberger
- **Sound:** Debut album built around the "9PM (Till I Come)" template — Balearic melodic trance with the Roland JD-990 "meowing guitar" lead, soft supersaws, and atmospheric production. Described as containing "quiet compositions" — an unusual quality for a trance album. The restraint and melodic focus established ATB's identity from the start.
- **Key tracks:** "9PM (Till I Come)" (A minor, ~130 BPM — the JD-990 track, the defining ATB moment, UK #1 single), "Killer" (atmospheric melodic trance), "The Summer"
- **Chart:** "9PM (Till I Come)" reached #1 UK Singles Chart.
- **Significance:** Established ATB as a major force in melodic trance and proved that the genre could produce mainstream pop-scale hits. The JD-990 lead sound became one of the most recognizable synth patches in trance history.

### Two Worlds (2000)

- **Released:** 2000
- **Label:** Kontor Records
- **Produced by:** Andre Tanneberger
- **Sound:** Dual-disc concept album — one disc of club-oriented trance, one of ambient/downtempo material. The concept reflected ATB's interest in the contrast between high-energy dancefloor trance and contemplative atmospheric electronic music. Early exploration of the emotional range that would define his later work.
- **Key tracks:** "Don't Stop!" (Bb major, 134 BPM — first full vocal track, marking the transition from instrumental/texture-based vocals to actual vocal collaborations), "Let U Go" (built around a Wild Strawberries sample), "The Fields of Love" (collaboration with York)
- **Chart:** Strong European chart performance.
- **Significance:** The dual-disc concept showed ambition beyond single-formula trance. "Don't Stop!" marked the first time ATB committed to a full vocal performance as the centerpiece of a track, pointing toward the vocal trance direction that would peak with the Tiff Lacey collaborations.

### Dedicated / No Silence (2004)

- **Released:** 2004
- **Label:** Kontor Records
- **Produced by:** Andre Tanneberger
- **Sound:** Peak vocal trance. The collaboration with Tiff Lacey brought ATB's most emotionally resonant material — her voice provided the human element his productions had been building toward. The production maintained ATB's characteristic spaciousness while adding more prominent vocal arrangements and slightly more complex harmonic structures.
- **Key tracks:** "Ecstasy" (G#/Ab, 130 BPM — with Tiff Lacey, the peak ATB vocal trance moment), "Marrakech" (atmospheric instrumental), "Long Way Home"
- **Chart:** Strong dance chart performance internationally.
- **Significance:** Represents ATB's creative peak in vocal trance. Tiff Lacey's voice became inseparable from the ATB sound during this era. The production achieved a balance between atmospheric spaciousness and emotional vocal intensity that neither the earlier instrumental work nor the later pop-oriented material fully matched.

### Trilogy (2007)

- **Released:** 2007
- **Label:** Kontor Records
- **Produced by:** Andre Tanneberger
- **Sound:** Rock/pop shift — approximately 60% electronic / 40% live instrumentation. Guitar, bass, and live drums entered the arrangements alongside the signature synths. A deliberate move toward crossover appeal that divided the fanbase. The melodic sensibility remained, but the production palette expanded significantly beyond pure electronic trance.
- **Key tracks:** "What About Us" (with Roberta Carter Harrison)
- **Significance:** Marked ATB's move away from pure trance toward a broader electronic-pop-rock hybrid. The live instrumentation added warmth but diluted the atmospheric purity that defined his best work.

### Contact (2014)

- **Released:** 2014
- **Label:** Kontor Records
- **Produced by:** Andre Tanneberger
- **Sound:** Return to more electronic-focused production after the rock-influenced Trilogy period. Incorporated contemporary EDM elements while maintaining ATB's melodic sensibility.
- **Key tracks:** Various featuring different vocal collaborators
- **Significance:** Showed ATB adapting to the EDM era while retaining his identity.

### neXt (2017)

- **Released:** 2017
- **Label:** Kontor Records
- **Produced by:** Andre Tanneberger
- **Sound:** Continued evolution, balancing classic ATB melodic trance elements with modern production techniques. The title suggests forward-looking intent while the sound maintained continuity with his established identity.
- **Key tracks:** Various
- **Significance:** Demonstrated longevity and continued relevance nearly two decades into his career.

## Musical Analysis — What Makes ATB Sound Like ATB

### Production DNA

ATB's sound is defined by what is NOT there as much as what is. Where most trance maximizes density — stacking supersaws, layering pads, filling every frequency — ATB consistently chooses restraint. His arrangements are notably less dense than most trance, with space and air between elements. Generous reverb tails create a sense of physical space. The overall impression is Balearic — sun-drenched, open, horizon-gazing — rather than the industrial darkness or warehouse intensity of harder trance styles.

### The JD-990 Lead Sound

The signature ATB sound is the Roland JD-990 "meowing guitar" preset — the lead that defines "9PM (Till I Come)" and established his sonic identity. This is NOT a standard synthesized sound:

- **Synthesis method:** Differential loop-based synthesis — the JD-990 uses short waveform loops with crossfade points that create a unique, slightly unstable tonal quality
- **Critical technique:** MANUAL pitch wheel bends. The expressive, vocal-like quality of the lead comes from Tanneberger physically bending the pitch wheel during performance. This cannot be replicated with automated pitch modulation — the human inconsistency IS the sound.
- **Recreation approaches:** Omnisphere "Smoked Lap Steel b" preset gets close. Alternatively: sawtooth oscillator through a resonant low-pass filter with a plucked amplitude envelope and 2-3 semitone pitch bend applied manually.
- **Character:** The result sounds like a cross between a guitar, a voice, and a synthesizer — hence "meowing guitar." It is warm, expressive, and distinctly organic for a synth lead.

### Synth Patches

- **Soft supersaw stacks:** Unlike the aggressive, heavily detuned supersaws of hard trance, ATB's supersaws are softer — less detuning, less saturation, more transparent. They provide harmonic warmth without dominating the mix.
- **Pad layers:** Wide, airy pads with long reverb tails. More atmospheric than melodic — they create the "space" that defines ATB's productions.
- **Breathy vocal textures:** Female vocal fragments processed as synth-like textural elements — not traditional vocals but atmospheric components of the mix.

### Drum Programming

Less aggressive than standard trance. The kick is present but not overwhelming. Hi-hat patterns are more restrained. The drums serve the melody rather than the other way around — in typical ATB arrangements, the melodic elements lead and the rhythm supports, which is the inverse of most trance production.

### Mix Characteristics

- **Wide and airy:** Extreme stereo width on pads and reverb tails
- **Generous reverb:** Long tails that create a sense of open physical space — the opposite of dry, in-your-face club mixes
- **Soft dynamics:** Less aggressive compression than typical trance. The mix breathes rather than pumps.
- **Melodic elements forward:** The JD-990 lead or vocal sits at the front of the mix, with drums and bass supportive rather than dominant

### Arrangement Formula

ATB arrangements follow a distinctive arc that prioritizes melody over energy:

1. **Intro:** Atmospheric — pads, reverb, space. Establishing mood before rhythm.
2. **Build:** Gradual introduction of rhythmic elements beneath the evolving melodic content
3. **First melodic statement:** The JD-990 lead or primary melody enters — THIS is the moment, not the beat drop
4. **Verse/vocal section:** If present, vocals enter over stripped-back production
5. **Main section:** Full arrangement with melody, drums, bass, pads — but still less dense than comparable trance
6. **Breakdown:** Return to atmosphere — pads, reverb, space. The breakdown in ATB is a return to the contemplative mood of the intro, not just a drop-out for dramatic tension.
7. **Final build:** Gradual reassembly into the fullest version of the arrangement

### Vocal Approach Evolution

Three distinct phases:

1. **Early (1998-2001):** Breathy female vocal fragments as TEXTURE — atmospheric elements, not lead vocals
2. **Peak vocal (2002-2006):** Full vocal collaborations (Tiff Lacey, Roberta Carter Harrison) as emotional centerpieces
3. **Later (2007+):** Various vocal collaborators integrated into increasingly pop-oriented arrangements

## Reference Tracks (ATB Essential Listening)

### Defining the Sound
- **"9PM (Till I Come)"** (Movin' Melodies, 1999) — A minor, ~130 BPM. THE ATB track. The Roland JD-990 "meowing guitar" lead with manual pitch wheel bends over a spacious, Balearic trance arrangement. UK #1 single. The restraint is the key — where other trance producers would fill every gap, ATB lets the melody breathe in open space. This track is a masterclass in melodic trance minimalism.
- **"Ecstasy"** (Dedicated/No Silence, 2004) — G#/Ab, 130 BPM. With Tiff Lacey. The peak vocal trance ATB moment. Lacey's voice provides the emotional anchor that the JD-990 lead provided in "9PM" — warm, human, expressive. The production maintains characteristic spaciousness while building to genuine emotional climax.

### Vocal Evolution
- **"Don't Stop!"** (Two Worlds, 2000) — Bb major, 134 BPM. The first full vocal ATB track. Marks the transition from breathy vocal fragments as texture to actual vocal performance as centerpiece. The production is still instrumental-trance-first, but the vocal reshapes the arrangement's emotional center.
- **"Let U Go"** (Two Worlds, 2000) — Built around a Wild Strawberries sample. Shows ATB's ear for found-sound melodic material — taking an existing vocal fragment and building an atmospheric trance arrangement around it.

### Collaboration
- **"The Fields of Love"** (Two Worlds, 2000) — Collaboration with York. Two Balearic trance producers combining their approaches. The result is wide, airy, and emotionally warm — pure atmospheric melodic trance with the spaciousness doubled.

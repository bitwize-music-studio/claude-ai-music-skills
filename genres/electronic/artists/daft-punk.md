# Daft Punk — Deep Dive

## Overview

Daft Punk were a French electronic music duo from Paris, active from 1993 to 2021. The duo consisted of Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo. Over 28 years, they released four studio albums, won eight Grammy Awards (including Album of the Year), sold tens of millions of records worldwide, and fundamentally shaped the trajectory of electronic music — from underground French house to mainstream global pop.

Daft Punk pioneered "French house" (also called "filter house"), built around heavily filtered disco and funk samples, four-on-the-floor beats, and vocoder-processed vocals. Their sound evolved dramatically across their career: from the raw, sample-heavy club tracks of Homework (1997) through Discovery's (2001) pop-infused vocoder anthems and Human After All's (2005) stripped-down repetition to Random Access Memories' (2013) lavish live-musician disco, which won Album of the Year at the 56th Grammy Awards. They also composed the orchestral-electronic score for TRON: Legacy (2010).

Their robot personas — chrome and gold helmets worn in all public appearances from approximately 2001 onward — became one of the most iconic visual identities in music history. The helmets reinforced a philosophy of anonymity: the music should matter more than the personalities behind it. As Bangalter put it: "We did not choose to become robots. There was an accident in our studio. We were working on our sampler, and at exactly 9:09 AM on September 9, 1999, it exploded."

Their live performances, particularly the Alive 2006/2007 world tour with its legendary LED pyramid stage, helped catalyze the global EDM explosion of the late 2000s and 2010s. The duo announced their split on February 22, 2021, through an eight-minute video titled "Epilogue" featuring footage from their 2006 film Electroma.

Rolling Stone ranked Daft Punk the 12th-greatest musical duo of all time. The New York Times credited them with helping make dance music mainstream.

## Members

### Thomas Bangalter — Production, Keyboards, Drum Machines, Vocals (1993–2021)

- **Born:** January 3, 1975, Paris, France
- **Background:** Son of Daniel Vangarde (born Daniel Bangalter), a prolific French songwriter and producer responsible for disco hits including "D.I.S.C.O." by Ottawan and work with the Gibson Brothers. Thomas grew up surrounded by his father's record collection of funk, soul, and disco — a direct pipeline to the samples that would fuel Daft Punk's music.
- **Education:** Met Guy-Manuel at Lycee Carnot secondary school in Paris in 1987. They bonded over shared interests in films and music of the 1960s and 1970s — "very basic cult teenager things, from Easy Rider to the Velvet Underground."
- **Pre-Daft Punk:** In 1992, Bangalter (bass), Homem-Christo (guitar), and Laurent Brancowitz (guitar/drums) formed the guitar band Darlin', named after the Beach Boys song. The trio disbanded after about six months, two gigs, and four songs. Bangalter described it as "pretty average." A dismissive Melody Maker review by Dave Jennings called their music "a daft punky thrash" — providing the name for their next project. Brancowitz went on to co-found Phoenix.
- **Role in Daft Punk:** Primary programmer and beat architect. Handled much of the sampling, drum machine programming, and bassline construction. Served as the duo's more public-facing member and frequent spokesperson.
- **Solo work and side projects:**
  - **Stardust** — Collaborative project with Alan Braxe and Benjamin Diamond. Their 1998 single "Music Sounds Better with You" became a massive international hit, reaching #2 on the UK Singles Chart and selling over 2 million copies. One of the defining French house tracks.
  - **Together** — Project with DJ Falcon (Stephane Queme). Released "Together" (2000) and "So Much Love to Give."
  - **Roulé Records** — Bangalter's own label, founded in 1995. Released his solo singles ("Trax on da Rocks" EPs, "Spinal Scratch") and Stardust material.
  - **Film scores:** Composed the soundtrack for Gaspar Noe's Irreversible (2002). Served as sound effects director for Noe's Enter the Void (2009). Contributed music to Noe's Climax (2018).
  - **Mythologies** (2023) — Post-Daft Punk solo orchestral album. Score for a 90-minute ballet by choreographer Angelin Preljocaj, performed by the Orchestre National Bordeaux Aquitaine. Influenced by Baroque music and American minimalism. Notably contains no electronic instruments whatsoever. Released on Erato Records. Bangalter stated: "As much as I love this character, the last thing I would want to be, in the world we live in, in 2023, is a robot."
  - **CHIROPTERA** — Art-driven solo project post-split.
  - **La Grande Veillee** (October 2023) — Performed an original composition alongside 32 dancers at the reopening of the Theatre de la Ville in Paris during a 25-hour event.

### Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo — Production, Keyboards, Guitar, Vocals (1993–2021)

- **Born:** February 8, 1974, Neuilly-sur-Seine, France
- **Background:** Of Portuguese descent (family name translates to "Man of Christ"). More reserved and private than Bangalter throughout the duo's career.
- **Role in Daft Punk:** Melodic and harmonic direction, synthesizer work, guitar parts. Generally described as focusing more on the sonic textures, chord progressions, and overall feel. The more musically introspective of the two.
- **Solo work and side projects:**
  - **Le Knight Club** — Project with Eric Chedeville. Released several singles of sample-based French house.
  - **Crydamoure Records** — Label co-founded with Chedeville, named from a variation of the French "cri d'amour" ("cry of love"). Released material by Homem-Christo's brother Paul (as Play Paul), as well as Deelat, Raw Man, The Eternals, and others. Crydamoure served as the counterpart to Bangalter's Roule label.
  - **Production for other artists:** Produced Sebastien Tellier's album Sexuality (2008). Co-produced Kavinsky's "Nightcall" (2010) — the track that defined modern synthwave through the Drive soundtrack. Worked on Charlotte Gainsbourg's album Rest (2017). Featured on Tellier's My God Is Blue (2012).
  - **Post-Daft Punk:** Has remained largely out of the public eye. As of late 2025, rumored to be working on a solo album — Emmanuel de Buretel of Because Music stated "Guy-Man fait son album" ("Guy-Man is making his album").

## Albums

### Homework (1997)

- **Released:** January 20, 1997
- **Label:** Virgin Records (licensed, not assigned — the duo retained ownership)
- **Produced by:** Daft Punk, in Bangalter's bedroom studio
- **Sound:** Raw French house. Heavily filtered disco and funk samples over driving four-on-the-floor beats. Minimal arrangement — loops, filters, and repetition as compositional tools. The sound that defined "filter house." Recorded largely on cheap hardware: Roland TR-909 drum machine, TB-303 bassline, E-mu SP-1200 sampler (12-bit, giving a gritty crunch), Juno-106, and the $300 Alesis 3630 compressor. No software was used.
- **Key tracks:** "Da Funk" (breakout single, sold 30,000 copies before the album), "Around the World" (top five hit across Europe, built on a single repeating vocal phrase over a pulsing bassline), "Revolution 909," "Burnin'," "Rollin' & Scratchin'," "Alive"
- **Chart:** #3 in France (Platinum). Top 10 in several European countries.
- **Music videos:** Michel Gondry directed the "Around the World" video (choreographed dancers representing different instruments) and Spike Jonze directed the "Da Funk" video (a man-dog walking through New York).
- **Significance:** Established Daft Punk and French house as a global force. Proved that underground dance music could achieve mainstream success without compromising its repetitive, hypnotic structure.

### Discovery (2001)

- **Released:** February 26, 2001 (Japan), March 12, 2001 (worldwide)
- **Label:** Virgin Records
- **Sound:** A dramatic evolution — pop song structures, vocoder-heavy melodies, and lush arrangements replaced Homework's raw minimalism. Heavily sampled obscure disco, soul, and soft rock records from the late 1970s and early 1980s, chopping and repitching them through the E-mu SP-1200 and layering vocoder vocals on top. The result was a warm, nostalgic, emotionally resonant electronic pop album unlike anything in dance music at the time.
- **Key tracks:** "One More Time" (#1 in France, #1 Billboard Dance chart, one of the most recognizable dance tracks ever made — features vocals by Romanthony), "Digital Love" (sample of George Duke's "I Love You More"), "Harder Better Faster Stronger" (vocoder anthem, later famously sampled by Kanye West for "Stronger"), "Something About Us" (slow, romantic vocoder ballad), "Veridis Quo," "Aerodynamic," "Face to Face" (featuring Todd Edwards)
- **Chart:** #2 in France (Triple Platinum). Top 10 in Australia, Canada, UK.
- **Interstella 5555:** The entire album serves as the soundtrack to Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem (2003), an animated film supervised by Leiji Matsumoto (Space Pirate Captain Harlock, Galaxy Express 999). Each track corresponds to a chapter of the story. The project reflects Daft Punk's love of Japanese animation.
- **Significance:** Transformed Daft Punk from underground house producers into global pop icons. Demonstrated that electronic music could be emotionally rich and narratively ambitious. "Harder Better Faster Stronger" became a cultural touchstone, later winning a Grammy in its live form.

### Human After All (2005)

- **Released:** March 14, 2005
- **Label:** Virgin Records
- **Produced by:** Daft Punk, reportedly in six weeks
- **Sound:** Stripped-down, repetitive, deliberately abrasive. Distorted guitar-like synth riffs, minimal vocal phrases looped to the point of hypnosis or irritation. A stark contrast to Discovery's lushness. Feels like a concept album about dehumanization and technological anxiety.
- **Key tracks:** "Robot Rock" (built on a Breakwater sample), "Technologic" (rapid-fire vocoder list of tech verbs: "buy it, use it, break it, fix it..."), "Human After All," "The Prime Time of Your Life," "Emotion"
- **Chart:** #1 Billboard Dance/Electronic Albums. #3 in France.
- **Reception:** Mixed reviews on release. Criticized for being too repetitive and underdeveloped. Has been reappraised over time, particularly in the context of the Alive 2006/2007 tour, where its tracks were mashed up with Discovery and Homework material to spectacular effect.
- **Significance:** Polarizing but intentional. The album's cold, mechanical energy served as perfect raw material for live remixing.

### TRON: Legacy (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) (2010)

- **Released:** December 3, 2010
- **Label:** Walt Disney Records
- **Sound:** Orchestral-electronic hybrid. Daft Punk composed for an 85-piece orchestra (recorded at AIR Lyndhurst Studios in London with Joseph Trapanese as orchestrator) alongside their signature synths and electronic production. The score blends sweeping, cinematic orchestral passages with pulsing electronic rhythms and the duo's characteristic vocoder textures. Dark, atmospheric, and immersive.
- **Key tracks:** "Derezzed," "The Grid" (featuring Jeff Bridges speaking the opening monologue), "End of Line," "Solar Sailer," "Adagio for TRON," "Rinzler"
- **Chart:** #10 Billboard 200 (Daft Punk's first top-five US album). Certified Gold.
- **Significance:** Demonstrated Daft Punk's range beyond dance music. Proved they could compose for orchestra while retaining their identity. Reignited interest in orchestral-electronic fusion scores.

### Random Access Memories (2013)

- **Released:** May 17, 2013
- **Label:** Columbia Records (first album not on Virgin)
- **Produced by:** Daft Punk, with a massive roster of session musicians and collaborators
- **Recording:** Recorded at Henson Recording Studios, Conway Recording Studios, and Capitol Studios in California; Electric Lady Studios in New York City; and Gang Recording Studio in Paris. Estimated cost: over one million dollars.
- **Sound:** A radical departure — live musicians replaced samples almost entirely. The duo recruited legendary session players to recreate the sound of late 1970s and early 1980s American music, particularly Los Angeles studio culture. The result is a lavish, warm, analog-sounding album that pays homage to disco, progressive rock, soft rock, and the craft of studio musicianship. Limited electronic instruments to drum machines, a custom modular synthesizer, and vintage vocoders.
- **Key collaborators:**
  - **Nile Rodgers** (Chic) — Guitar on "Get Lucky," "Lose Yourself to Dance," "Doin' It Right"
  - **Pharrell Williams** — Vocals on "Get Lucky" and "Lose Yourself to Dance"
  - **Giorgio Moroder** — Spoken-word monologue on "Giorgio by Moroder" (telling the story of his life and career)
  - **Julian Casablancas** (The Strokes) — Vocals on "Instant Crush"
  - **Paul Williams** — Vocals and lyrics on "Touch" and "Beyond"
  - **Todd Edwards** — Vocals on "Fragments of Time"
  - **Panda Bear** (Animal Collective) — Vocals on "Doin' It Right"
  - **Chilly Gonzales** — Piano on "Within"
  - **DJ Falcon** — Featured on "Contact"
  - **Session musicians:** Omar Hakim (drums), Nathan East (bass), John "JR" Robinson (drums), Paul Jackson Jr. (guitar), James Genus (bass), Greg Leisz (pedal steel), Chris Caswell (keyboards), Thomas Bloch (Ondes Martenot on "Touch")
- **Key tracks:** "Get Lucky" (ft. Pharrell & Nile Rodgers — global #1 hit, one of the best-selling digital singles of all time), "Instant Crush" (ft. Julian Casablancas), "Giorgio by Moroder," "Lose Yourself to Dance," "Touch," "Doin' It Right" (ft. Panda Bear), "Within," "Give Life Back to Music"
- **Chart:** #1 in France, UK, Australia, and numerous other countries. #1 Billboard 200.
- **Grammy Awards (56th, 2014):** Won five awards — Album of the Year, Record of the Year ("Get Lucky"), Best Dance/Electronica Album, Best Pop Duo/Group Performance ("Get Lucky"), Best Engineered Album Non-Classical. First electronic act to win Album of the Year.
- **Significance:** A statement against the loudness, compression, and laptop-centric production dominating EDM in 2013. Daft Punk went backwards in technology to go forward in sound. The album proved that electronic musicians could embrace live instrumentation without losing their identity.

## Live Performance

### Alive 2006/2007

Daft Punk's live shows were rare events rather than regular touring — which made each appearance an occasion. The Alive 2006/2007 tour was their masterpiece.

- **The Pyramid:** An iconic inverted LED pyramid stage, approximately 24 feet tall, housing the duo inside. Covered in programmable LED panels that synchronized with the music. Rose dramatically during performances.
- **The mashups:** Rather than playing album tracks in sequence, Daft Punk created elaborate mashups combining songs from Homework, Discovery, and Human After All. "Around the World / Harder Better Faster Stronger" became a signature live moment.
- **Bercy, Paris (June 14, 2007):** The recording that became Alive 2007.
- **Coachella 2006:** Their headline set at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival is widely considered one of the greatest live electronic performances ever. It catalyzed the EDM festival explosion that followed in the late 2000s.

### Alive 2007 (Live Album)

- **Released:** November 19, 2007
- **Label:** Virgin Records
- **Chart:** #1 Billboard Top Dance/Electronic Albums
- **Grammy Awards (51st, 2009):** Won Best Electronic/Dance Album and Best Dance Recording ("Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger" live version). These were Daft Punk's first Grammy wins.

### Earlier Live Performances

- **Alive 1997** — First live album, released 2001. Recorded at the Que Club, Birmingham, UK, on November 10, 1997.

## Musical Analysis — What Makes Daft Punk Sound Like Daft Punk

### Sampling

Sampling was the foundation of Daft Punk's early work. They specialized in finding obscure disco, soul, funk, and soft rock records from the late 1970s and early 1980s, then chopping, looping, filtering, and repitching them into new compositions.

Key technique: Using the E-mu SP-1200 sampler (12-bit), whose low bit rate gave samples a gritty, crunchy character. The imperfections became a feature — lo-fi warmth that contrasted with the precision of their drum programming.

Discovery is the sampling masterwork. "One More Time" samples Eddie Johns' "More Spell on You." "Digital Love" samples George Duke's "I Love You More." "Harder Better Faster Stronger" samples Edwin Birdsong's "Cola Bottle Baby." "Face to Face" samples Electric Light Orchestra's "Evil Woman."

Random Access Memories deliberately moved away from sampling, replacing it with live musicians recreating the feel of those same source eras.

### Filter House

Daft Punk were the primary architects of "French house" or "filter house." The technique: run samples through resonant low-pass filters, sweeping the cutoff frequency to create the characteristic "wah" effect. Combined with sidechain compression (pumping the mix against the kick drum), this created the warm, breathing, dance-floor-oriented sound that defined late-1990s French electronic music.

### Vocoders and Voice Processing

The robotic vocal sound is Daft Punk's most recognizable signature. They used multiple approaches across their catalog:

- **Roland VP-330 Vocoder Plus** and **SVC-350** — Classic hardware vocoders used across multiple albums
- **Digitech Vocalist** — Used for specific vocal effects
- **Auto-Tune** — Used creatively (not correctively) for the characteristic pitch-locked vocal sound
- **Talk box** — Used in combination with vocoders, sometimes feeding talkbox output through a vocoder for layered effects

Bangalter stated: "People always ask us what vocoder we use, but every one of our vocal tracks uses a different vocoder effect."

On Discovery, vocal treatments were processed heavily with reverbs, talkboxes, and various hardware vocoders, often combining multiple processing chains on a single vocal.

### Synthesizers and Drum Machines

Core equipment across their career:

- **Roland TR-909** — Primary drum machine, providing the iconic kick and hi-hat patterns
- **Roland TB-303** — Acid basslines, particularly on Homework
- **Roland Juno-106** — Pads and chord work
- **Oberheim OB-8** — Polyphonic analog synth for lush pads
- **Moog Minimoog** — Lead synths and bass
- **E-mu SP-1200** — Primary sampler (12-bit)
- **Oberheim DMX** and **Linn drum machines** — Used on several tracks instead of the usual 808/909
- **Custom modular synthesizer** — Built for Random Access Memories
- **Alesis 3630 compressor** — The $300 compressor used as the main compressor on both Homework and Discovery. Bangalter: "The instrument itself is not as important as the way we use it."

### Repetition as Composition

Daft Punk embraced repetition as a structural principle rather than a limitation. "Around the World" repeats its title phrase 144 times. "Technologic" loops a list of verbs endlessly. "Robot Rock" rides a single riff for its entire duration. This connects to minimalist composition (Steve Reich, Philip Glass) as much as to dance music's loop-based tradition. The repetition creates hypnotic, trance-like states on the dance floor.

### Production Philosophy

No software was used during the making of Homework and Discovery — everything was hardware-based. Bangalter: "Instruments come with certain instructions in the manual, and many people can't look beyond those rules. People ask us why we like to use vocoders or electric keyboards from the '60s, but to us instruments are just tools."

For Random Access Memories, they reversed their approach — recruiting elite session musicians to play live, recording in legendary studios, and spending over a million dollars on production. The shift wasn't contradiction; it was the same philosophy (creating warm, human-feeling music) pursued through different means.

### Genre Evolution

The defining arc of Daft Punk's career is genre evolution:

1. **Homework (1997):** French house / filter house — raw, sample-driven, club-oriented
2. **Discovery (2001):** Electro-pop / synth-pop — melodic, vocoder-heavy, emotionally resonant
3. **Human After All (2005):** Minimal electronic / electro — stripped-down, repetitive, abrasive
4. **TRON: Legacy (2010):** Orchestral-electronic — cinematic, symphonic, atmospheric
5. **Random Access Memories (2013):** Disco / funk — live musicians, analog warmth, studio craft

Each album sounds almost nothing like the one before it. This restlessness is central to Daft Punk's identity.

## Interstella 5555 and Visual Projects

### Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem (2003)

A 65-minute animated film set entirely to Discovery's tracklist, with no dialogue. Supervised by Leiji Matsumoto (creator of Space Pirate Captain Harlock and Galaxy Express 999), produced by Toei Animation. The story follows an alien band kidnapped and brought to Earth by an evil music industry manager. Each Discovery track scores a chapter of the narrative. The project reflects Daft Punk's deep love of Japanese animation and their belief that music and visual storytelling should be inseparable.

### Electroma (2006)

A 74-minute experimental film directed by Daft Punk (credited as Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo). Two robots (played by actors Peter Hurteau and Michael Reich) attempt to become human in a world of robots. Contains no Daft Punk music — the soundtrack features Brian Eno, Todd Rundgren, Curtis Mayfield, and others. Premiered at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival (Directors' Fortnight). Divisive on release but has gained cult status.

### "Epilogue" (2021)

The duo's breakup was announced through an eight-minute video using footage from Electroma, ending with one robot walking away from an explosion. No words, no interviews — just the image.

## Legacy and Influence

**Pioneering French house:** Alongside Cassius, Etienne de Crecy, and others, Daft Punk defined the "French touch" — but they transcended the scene, becoming global pop stars while their contemporaries remained niche.

**Bridging underground and mainstream:** Daft Punk proved that dance music producers could achieve pop-scale success without sacrificing artistic control or creative ambition. Their licensing deal with Virgin (retaining ownership) set a model for electronic artists' business relationships.

**Catalyzing EDM:** The Alive 2006/2007 tour, especially the Coachella 2006 headline set, is widely credited with catalyzing the EDM explosion that dominated the late 2000s and 2010s. The pyramid stage became the template for immersive electronic live experiences.

**Influencing hip-hop:** Kanye West's "Stronger" (2007) sampled "Harder Better Faster Stronger," becoming a massive crossover hit and introducing Daft Punk to hip-hop audiences. The Weeknd, Pharrell, and numerous R&B/hip-hop artists cite Daft Punk's production as influential.

**The anonymity model:** The robot personas influenced a generation of masked/anonymous electronic artists: Deadmau5, Marshmello, and others adopted similar identity-concealing approaches.

**Random Access Memories as counter-statement:** In 2013, at the peak of EDM's laptop-and-drop dominance, RAM's live-musician, analog approach was a deliberate provocation — proving that electronic artists could embrace warmth, craft, and human performance. Its Album of the Year Grammy win validated the argument.

**Visual integration:** Interstella 5555, Electroma, the robot personas, Michel Gondry's music videos — Daft Punk treated visual presentation as inseparable from music, setting standards for electronic music's visual culture.

## Reference Tracks (Daft Punk Essential Listening)

### Defining the Sound
- **"Da Funk"** (Homework, 1997) — The track that launched Daft Punk. Gritty, filtered synth riff over a driving house beat. Lo-fi yet deeply funky — shows how a single hook and relentless groove can create an iconic track.
- **"Around the World"** (Homework, 1997) — The title phrase repeated 144 times over a pulsing bassline. Proves that minimalism and repetition can be euphoric. Michel Gondry's choreographed video is equally iconic.
- **"One More Time"** (Discovery, 2001) — The euphoric anthem. Romanthony's compressed vocals over a chopped disco sample and four-on-the-floor beat. One of the most recognizable dance tracks ever recorded.
- **"Digital Love"** (Discovery, 2001) — Romantic vocoder pop built on a George Duke sample. Shows Daft Punk's ability to create genuine emotional resonance through electronic processing.

### Vocoder Mastery
- **"Harder Better Faster Stronger"** (Discovery, 2001) — Vocoder as lead instrument, chopping Edwin Birdsong's "Cola Bottle Baby" into a robotic anthem. Later sampled by Kanye West; the live version won a Grammy.
- **"Something About Us"** (Discovery, 2001) — A slow, intimate vocoder love ballad. Proves processed vocals can convey tenderness and vulnerability.
- **"Instant Crush"** (Random Access Memories, 2013) — Julian Casablancas' vocals heavily processed through vocoder over a driving disco-rock arrangement. The vocoder as emotional amplifier rather than mask.

### Genre Evolution
- **"Get Lucky"** (Random Access Memories, 2013) — Nile Rodgers' guitar, Pharrell's vocals, live session musicians — disco reborn through an electronic duo's vision. Five Grammy wins. One of the best-selling digital singles of all time.
- **"Giorgio by Moroder"** (Random Access Memories, 2013) — Nine minutes spanning Giorgio Moroder's spoken-word autobiography over music that evolves from jazz lounge to analog synth to orchestral disco to chaotic free-form. A history of electronic music compressed into one track.

### Live and Cinematic
- **"Derezzed"** (TRON: Legacy, 2010) — Orchestral-electronic hybrid. Dark, pulsing, cinematic. Shows Daft Punk's ability to compose beyond the dance floor.

## Essential Context for Songwriting

When writing music inspired by Daft Punk's sound, keep in mind:

1. **Repetition is not laziness** — It is a deliberate compositional choice. Build hypnotic grooves through loops that evolve subtly through filter sweeps and arrangement additions.
2. **Vocoders convey emotion** — Daft Punk proved that processed vocals can express love, longing, joy, and melancholy. Don't treat vocoders as novelty effects.
3. **Samples as raw material** — The original sample should be transformed, not just looped. Filter, repitch, chop, layer.
4. **The bass matters** — Whether synth bass (Homework), programmed bass (Discovery), or live bass guitar (RAM), the low end drives everything.
5. **Less is more** — Homework and Human After All often use just a few elements. Space and restraint make each element hit harder.
6. **Genre boundaries are suggestions** — Daft Punk moved from house to pop to cinema to disco across four albums. The connecting thread is personality, not genre.

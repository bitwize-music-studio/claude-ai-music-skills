# Trip-Hop

## Genre Overview

Trip-hop is a downtempo electronic music genre that emerged from Bristol, UK during the early 1990s, blending hip-hop beats with atmospheric samples, psychedelic textures, and moody aesthetics. The term itself was coined by British music magazine Mixmag in 1994 to describe the sound emanating from Bristol's vibrant music scene, though many of the genre's pioneers have expressed ambivalence toward the label. Characterized by slow, syncopated breakbeats (typically 85-110 BPM), layered instrumentation, and introspective lyrics, trip-hop creates a cinematic, late-night sound that draws from breakbeats, dub reggae, ambient music, jazz, and soul.

The genre's holy trinity - Massive Attack, Portishead, and Tricky - established the Bristol Sound that defined trip-hop's golden era. Massive Attack's "Blue Lines" (1991) is widely considered the genre's founding document, fusing hip-hop production with soul samples and live instrumentation. Portishead's "Dummy" (1994) introduced a darker, more cinematic approach with Beth Gibbons' haunting vocals over scratchy samples and spy-film atmospheres. Tricky, initially a Massive Attack collaborator, pushed the genre into more paranoid, claustrophobic territory with "Maxinquaye" (1995), incorporating whispered vocals and fragmented production. Together, these three acts created a template for downtempo electronic music that prioritized atmosphere, texture, and emotional depth over dancefloor functionality.

Beyond Bristol, trip-hop's influence spread globally and evolved through various interpretations. DJ Shadow's "Endtroducing....." (1996) demonstrated the genre's potential as purely instrumental sample-based art, while Morcheeba and Sneaker Pimps brought more accessible, pop-friendly approaches. The late 1990s and 2000s saw trip-hop's DNA absorbed into adjacent genres - Radiohead's "Kid A" borrowed its atmospheric production techniques, while artists like Bonobo and Zero 7 carried its sophisticated, organic approach into the new millennium. Though the genre's commercial peak has passed, its influence persists in contemporary downtempo, dark pop, and atmospheric electronic music, with Massive Attack continuing to evolve their sound and artists like James Blake and Burial carrying forward trip-hop's commitment to intimacy and mood.

# Disco

## Genre Overview

Disco is a dance-oriented genre that emerged in the 1970s, built on pulsing four-on-the-floor drum beats, orchestral strings, funky basslines, and soulful vocals. With its emphasis on groove, rhythm, and pure danceability, disco created the soundtrack for nightclub culture and remains a defining sound of the era. From the lush orchestration of classic disco to modern nu-disco reinterpretations, the genre celebrates rhythm, celebration, and the communal joy of the dance floor.

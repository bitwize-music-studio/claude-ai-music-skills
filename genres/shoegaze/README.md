# Shoegaze

## Genre Overview

Shoegaze is an ethereal, guitar-driven genre characterized by heavy use of effects pedals, ethereal vocals buried in lush layers of sound, and a focus on atmosphere and texture over traditional song structure. Emerging from the UK indie rock scene in the late 1980s, shoegaze creates walls of sound through layered guitars, ethereal synths, and often indecipherable lyrics. The name derives from performers' tendency to look down at their effects pedals while playing rather than engaging with the audience.

## Characteristics

- **Instrumentation**: Electric guitar (heavily effected), bass, drums, synthesizers/keyboards
- **Vocals**: Often ethereal and breathy, frequently buried or layered within the mix
- **Production**: Dense, layered soundscapes with heavy reverb, delay, and chorus effects
- **Energy**: Dreamy, hypnotic, and introspective; builds rather than explodes
- **Structure**: Often features walls of sound, feedback-laden passages, and ambient sections
- **Effects**: Extensive use of distortion, reverb, delay, chorus, and modulation

# Rock

## Genre Overview

Rock music is a genre rooted in rebellion, energy, and the electric guitar. Emerging in the 1950s from the fusion of rhythm and blues, country, and gospel in American cities like Memphis, Chicago, and Detroit, rock quickly became the dominant popular music of the 20th century. The early pioneers—Chuck Berry, Little Richard, and Elvis Presley—established rock's core DNA: driving rhythms, amplified guitars, and an attitude that challenged social conventions.

Through the 1960s, rock splintered into myriad subgenres as British bands like The Beatles and The Rolling Stones reinterpreted American roots music and fed it back across the Atlantic. The psychedelic experimentation of the late 1960s gave way to the arena-filling bombast of 1970s classic rock, the raw aggression of punk, the synthesizer explorations of new wave, and the introspective complexity of progressive rock. The 1980s saw rock embrace both commercial polish (hair metal, arena rock) and underground intensity (hardcore, college rock). The 1990s brought grunge, alternative rock, and the mainstreaming of indie sensibilities, while the 2000s and 2010s saw rock fragment further into post-punk revival, garage rock resurgence, and countless hybrid forms.

At its core, rock remains defined by the interplay of electric guitar, bass, and drums—instruments that prioritize performance, dynamics, and visceral impact over pristine production. Whether delivered in a sweaty club or a massive arena, rock music connects listeners through raw energy, memorable riffs, and the promise that anyone with three chords and the truth can make something that matters.

## Characteristics

- **Instrumentation**: Electric guitar (clean, overdriven, or distorted), bass guitar, drums (acoustic kit with hi-hats, snare, kick, toms, cymbals), sometimes keyboards/piano/organ; guitars often employ power chords, riffs, and solos as defining elements
- **Vocals**: Ranges from melodic and smooth to raspy, shouted, or screamed; often placed prominently in the mix; lyrics can be personal, political, abstract, or narrative; backing vocals and harmonies common in many subgenres
- **Production**: Spans from raw lo-fi recordings (garage, punk) to highly produced studio albums (classic rock, arena rock); key sonic elements include guitar amp distortion, room ambiance, and dynamic range; modern productions may layer multiple guitar tracks
- **Energy/Mood**: Generally high-energy and performance-driven; emotional range from aggressive and defiant to introspective and melancholic; emphasizes authenticity and attitude over technical perfection (though virtuosity is celebrated in some subgenres)
- **Structure**: Verse-chorus-verse with bridge; guitar solos and instrumental breaks; dynamic builds from quiet verses to loud choruses; intros, outros, and codas; songs typically 3-5 minutes (though progressive rock often extends much longer)
- **Tempo**: Wide range—power ballads (60-80 BPM), mid-tempo rock (90-120 BPM), driving rock (120-140 BPM), punk/fast rock (160-200+ BPM)

## Lyric Conventions

- **Default rhyme scheme**: XAXA or ABAB — flexible, meaning over rhyme.
- **Rhyme quality**: Near rhymes acceptable and common. Emotional expression and imagery matter more than technical rhyming.
- **Verse structure**: Verses 4–8 lines. Choruses 4–6 lines. 6–10 syllables per line typical.
- **Key rule**: Specific imagery ("coffee gone cold on the counter") beats abstract statements ("I felt so sad"). Show, don't tell.
- **Avoid**: Forced perfect rhymes. Generic emotion words without grounding imagery. Cliches ("cold as ice," "learning to fly").
- **Density/pacing (Suno)**: Default **6 lines/verse** at 110-130 BPM. At 130-140: 4 lines. Guitar riffs need space. 120 BPM is the sweet spot. Topics: 2/verse.

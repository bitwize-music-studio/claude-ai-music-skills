# Incubus -- Deep Dive

## Overview

Incubus is an American rock band formed in 1991 in Calabasas, California, a suburb of Los Angeles in the western San Fernando Valley. The band was founded by vocalist Brandon Boyd, guitarist Mike Einziger, and drummer Jose Pasillas, who had known each other since elementary and middle school. Bassist Alex Katunich (performing as Dirk Lance) completed the original lineup. The four teenagers formed the band at age fifteen, initially playing Los Angeles's Sunset Strip venues including the Whisky a Go Go, the Roxy, and the Troubadour.

Incubus's career arc is defined by one of the most dramatic sonic evolutions in modern rock. Their earliest material drew heavily from the funk-metal of Faith No More, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Primus, and Mr. Bungle -- aggressive riffs, slap bass, turntable scratches, and even saxophone. By the time of Make Yourself (1999) and Morning View (2001), they had transformed into a melodic alternative rock band built around Brandon Boyd's expansive vocal range, Mike Einziger's effects-heavy guitar textures, and an atmospheric production approach that prioritized space and dynamics over brute force. That evolution wasn't a sudden pivot -- it was a gradual broadening of palette that incorporated elements of trip-hop, world music, new wave, and ambient textures alongside their rock foundation.

The commercial results were massive. Make Yourself (1999) went double platinum on the strength of "Drive," which peaked at No. 9 on the Billboard Hot 100 -- their only top-ten pop hit but a song that became ubiquitous on radio and MTV. Morning View (2001) debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 and also achieved double platinum. Light Grenades (2006) debuted at No. 1. As of 2022, Incubus has generated 12.4 million U.S. album consumption units and over 23 million records sold worldwide.

The band has remained active for over three decades, weathering lineup changes (most notably Ben Kenney replacing Dirk Lance in 2003, and Nicole Row joining as bassist in 2024), extended hiatuses, and shifting musical landscapes. Their 2023-2024 Morning View anniversary tour, performing the album in its entirety at arena-level venues, demonstrated their enduring connection with a fanbase that grew up on their music.

### Brandon Boyd (vocals, percussion)

- **Born:** February 15, 1976, Van Nuys, California. Raised in Calabasas.
- **Vocal style:** Wide-ranging tenor with exceptional control across chest voice, head voice, and falsetto. Early career featured aggressive, Mike Patton-influenced delivery with rapid-fire rhythmic phrasing. Evolved into a smoother, more ethereal approach emphasizing sustained melodic lines, breathy dynamics, and emotional vulnerability. Can pivot from whispered intimacy to powerful belt within a single phrase. His voice became one of the most distinctive and recognizable in 2000s alternative rock.
- **Influences:** Mike Patton (Faith No More, Mr. Bungle), Maynard James Keenan (Tool), Jeff Buckley, Bjork, Joni Mitchell.
- **Percussion:** Plays djembe and various hand percussion live, adding rhythmic texture during songs and extended jam sections.
- **Lyrical themes:** Introspection, personal growth, spirituality, environmentalism, relationships, philosophical questioning. Boyd's lyrics evolved from the playful abstraction of early albums to more contemplative, poetic territory.
- **Visual art:** Accomplished painter and visual artist. Published two books: *White Fluffy Clouds* (2003, art/poetry) and *From the Murks of the Sultry Abyss* (2007). His artwork has been exhibited in galleries.
- **Education:** Attended Calabasas High School where the band formed.
- **Side projects:** Sons of the Sea (2013, solo/side project with Brendan O'Brien producing).

### Mike Einziger (guitar, keyboards, piano)

- **Born:** June 21, 1976, Los Angeles, California.
- **Education:** Harvard University -- studied music composition during Incubus's hiatus period. Has "Veritas" (Harvard's motto) taped to his speaker cabinet.
- **Guitar style:** Effects-forward, texture-obsessed approach. Early career featured funk-metal riffing influenced by Tom Morello and Flea-era Red Hot Chili Peppers. Evolved into one of the most distinctive guitar voices in alternative rock through creative use of delay, phaser, ring modulation, and envelope filter effects. Prioritizes serving the song over virtuosic display -- credits this philosophical shift (around the Make Yourself era) as the point when Incubus broke through to larger audiences.
- **Equipment evolution:**
  - **Early career:** Ibanez guitars, switching to PRS Custom 24s around 1997
  - **Make Yourself / Morning View era:** PRS McCarty Archtops through Mesa/Boogie Dual Rectifier head into two 2x12 Mesa cabinets with Celestion 30s
  - **A Crow Left / Light Grenades era:** Fender Jazzmasters (owns a 1965 original and two reissues), Gibson SG Junior with P-90s
  - **Touring:** Ernie Ball/Music Man Albert Lee models (chosen for comfort and tuning stability after carpal tunnel surgery on left hand), Mesa/Boogie Dual Rectifier Trem-o-Verb combos
  - **Split rig (2006+):** Marshall Plexi Lead 100 through Marshall 2x12 cabs for drive, Vox AC30 for cleans
- **Signature pedals:** Electro-Harmonix Memory Man, Danelectro Reel Echo (his favorite), Dunlop Cry Baby, Hughes & Kettner Rotosphere, two Boss PH-2 Super Phasers, DOD Gonkulator Ring Mod, Boss RV-3 reverb/delay, Black Russian Big Muff, MXR Phase 90, DOD FX-25 Envelope Filter, EHX Micro POG
- **Multi-instrumentalist:** Also plays piano, Mellotron, pipa (Chinese lute -- used on "Aqueous Transmission"), analog synthesizers, Fender Rhodes, Wurlitzer, and Jerry Jones Master Sitar (used on "Nowhere Fast").
- **Collaborations outside Incubus:** Has worked with Pharrell Williams, Hans Zimmer, Skrillex, Tyler the Creator, Avicii, and Damian Marley.

### Jose Pasillas (drums, percussion)

- **Born:** April 26, 1976, Calabasas, California.
- **Drumming style:** Versatile and dynamic, capable of navigating Incubus's genre shifts from funk-metal grooves to atmospheric rock to world-music-influenced patterns. His playing emphasizes musicality and feel over flashy fills, with a pocket-oriented approach that anchors the band's increasingly textured sound. Uses both traditional and electronic percussion elements live.
- **Background:** Met Brandon Boyd in elementary school in Calabasas. Met Mike Einziger in middle school. One of three original members who have been with the band continuously since 1991.

### Chris "DJ Kilmore" Kilmore (turntables, keyboards, synths)

- **Joined:** 1998, replacing DJ Lyfe. First album: Make Yourself (1999).
- **Role:** Incubus's secret weapon. Unlike many bands that used turntables as a novelty in the late 1990s nu-metal era, Kilmore's contributions evolved from scratching and sampling into textural keyboard work, atmospheric synth pads, and electronic layering that became integral to the band's sonic identity. His role expanded significantly from Make Yourself onward as the band moved away from funk-metal toward atmospheric alternative rock.
- **Background:** Won a DJ competition judged by the band, which led to his recruitment.

- **Recorded:** 4th Street Recording, Santa Monica, California, between 1993--1995
- **Sound:** Pure funk-metal. Heavy riffing, slap bass, aggressive rhythms. Strong influences from Faith No More, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Primus, and Mr. Bungle. Mike Einziger has described it as more of a compilation of high school demos than a cohesive studio album.
- **Significance:** Documents the band's earliest sound before the addition of turntables and the evolution toward alternative rock. The band has not performed any songs from this album live since 2004.

### Enjoy Incubus EP (1997)

- **Label:** Epic/Immortal Records (major label debut)
- **6 tracks** -- re-recordings of songs from Fungus Amongus and the Let Me Tell Ya 'Bout Root Beer demo, plus the previously unreleased "Version"
- **Significance:** First major label release after signing a seven-record deal with Sony's Epic/Immortal in 1996. Created to give the band a release to tour behind while opening for Korn in Europe. Featured DJ Lyfe's turntable scratches added to re-recorded versions of earlier songs. Transitional release between the independent debut and S.C.I.E.N.C.E.

### S.C.I.E.N.C.E. (1997)

- **Released:** September 9, 1997
- **Label:** Epic/Immortal Records
- **Lineup:** Brandon Boyd, Mike Einziger, Alex Katunich, Jose Pasillas, DJ Lyfe
- **Sound:** Explosive expansion of the band's palette. Funk-metal core now infused with turntable scratches, electronic elements, hip-hop rhythms, world music influences, and experimental song structures. Boyd's vocals range from rapid-fire rhythmic delivery to melodic singing. Einziger's guitar work begins incorporating more effects and textural approaches alongside the funk-metal riffing.
- **Key tracks:** "A Certain Shade of Green," "Redefine," "New Skin," "Glass"
- **Context:** Recorded with DJ Lyfe, who would be replaced by DJ Kilmore the following year. Features saxophone by Jeremy Wasser (who would later join Hoobastank's early lineup).

### Make Yourself (1999)

- **Released:** October 26, 1999
- **Label:** Epic/Immortal Records
- **Lineup:** Brandon Boyd, Mike Einziger, Alex Katunich, Jose Pasillas, DJ Kilmore (first album)
- **Producer:** Scott Litt (known for producing R.E.M.)
- **Sound:** The transformation. While still containing heavy moments, the album marked a decisive shift toward melodic alternative rock. Cleaner production, more dynamic range, atmospheric guitar textures replacing funk-metal riffing, and Boyd's vocals moving toward a smoother, more expressive delivery. DJ Kilmore's turntable work integrated more subtly than DJ Lyfe's scratching. Einziger credits this album with his philosophical shift toward serving the song rather than showcasing guitar technique.
- **Key tracks:** "Drive" (#9 Hot 100, #1 Alternative Songs -- their biggest hit), "Pardon Me" (#3 Alternative Songs), "Stellar" (#3 Alternative Songs), "Privilege," "Nowhere Fast" (features Jerry Jones Master Sitar)
- **Chart:** #47 Billboard 200 (peaked after slow climb; spent 98 weeks on chart)
- **Certification:** 2x Platinum (RIAA, 2 million US); Platinum in Canada; Gold in UK and New Zealand. Approximately 2.8 million copies sold worldwide.
- **Significance:** Commercial breakthrough. "Drive" became ubiquitous on radio and MTV, defining Incubus for mainstream audiences. The wistful, acoustic-driven ballad was a dramatic departure from their funk-metal roots and signaled the band's new direction.

### Morning View (2001)

- **Released:** October 23, 2001
- **Label:** Epic/Immortal Records
- **Lineup:** Brandon Boyd, Mike Einziger, Alex Katunich, Jose Pasillas, DJ Kilmore
- **Recorded:** At a rented house in Malibu overlooking the ocean on Morning View Drive (the album's namesake)
- **Sound:** The most atmospheric and sonically expansive Incubus album. Recording in a residential setting gave the album a relaxed, organic feel. Lush guitar textures, world music elements (including Einziger's pipa on "Aqueous Transmission"), warm production, and Boyd's most emotionally resonant vocal performances to date. The heaviness of earlier albums is largely replaced by dynamic contrast and melodic sophistication.
- **Key tracks:** "Wish You Were Here" (#2 Alternative Songs), "Nice to Know You" (#5 Alternative Songs), "Warning" (#8 Alternative Songs), "Are You In?", "Aqueous Transmission" (ambient closer built on pipa and Okinawan koto), "11am," "Mexico"
- **Chart:** #2 Billboard 200 (debuted with 266,000 first-week copies)
- **Certification:** 2x Platinum (RIAA). Spent 60 weeks on the Billboard 200.
- **Morning View XXIII (2023):** A reworked re-recording of the full album, released to coincide with the anniversary tour. First release to feature new bassist Nicole Row.
- **Significance:** Peak commercial and critical achievement. Cemented Incubus as an arena-level alternative rock act. The album's warm, expansive sound influenced a generation of 2000s rock bands. "Aqueous Transmission" demonstrated how far the band had traveled from funk-metal -- closing an album with ambient pipa and nature sounds.

### A Crow Left of the Murder... (2004)

- **Released:** February 3, 2004
- **Label:** Epic/Immortal Records
- **Lineup:** Brandon Boyd, Mike Einziger, Jose Pasillas, DJ Kilmore, **Ben Kenney** (first album, replacing Dirk Lance)
- **Producer:** Brendan O'Brien (known for Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, Rage Against the Machine)
- **Sound:** A deliberate return to heavier, more aggressive territory after Morning View's mellow expansiveness. Angular guitar riffs, denser arrangements, and a more urgent energy. Ben Kenney's bass style -- more understated and groove-oriented than Dirk Lance's flashy funk approach -- shifted the band's rhythmic character. The album balances aggression with the atmospheric textures developed on Morning View.
- **Key tracks:** "Megalomaniac" (politically charged, earned the band's only Grammy nomination), "Talk Shows on Mute," "Agoraphobia," "Sick Sad Little World," "Leech"
- **Chart:** #2 Billboard 200 (332,000 first-week copies)
- **Certification:** Platinum (RIAA)
- **Significance:** Successful integration of a new bassist. "Megalomaniac" -- with its anti-establishment lyrics and bold music video -- was the band's most politically direct statement. Proved Incubus could pivot between sonic approaches without losing their audience.

### Light Grenades (2006)

- **Released:** November 28, 2006
- **Label:** Epic/Immortal Records
- **Lineup:** Brandon Boyd, Mike Einziger, Jose Pasillas, DJ Kilmore, Ben Kenney
- **Sound:** Eclectic and wide-ranging. Einziger's guitar work reaches peak textural complexity, incorporating Jazzmasters and a split-amp rig for the first time. Songs range from radio-ready rock ("Anna Molly," "Love Hurts") to experimental detours. The album showcases Incubus's willingness to take risks within a major-label rock framework.
- **Key tracks:** "Anna Molly" (propulsive, riff-driven rocker), "Love Hurts," "Dig," "Oil and Water," "Rogues"
- **Chart:** #1 Billboard 200 (165,000 first-week US copies; 359,000 worldwide first week) -- their first and only No. 1 album
- **Certification:** Gold (RIAA)
- **Significance:** Chart peak but beginning of commercial decline. First No. 1 album with lower overall sales than predecessors, reflecting the broader collapse of album sales in the digital era.

### If Not Now, When? (2011)

- **Released:** July 12, 2011
- **Label:** Epic/Immortal Records
- **Lineup:** Brandon Boyd, Mike Einziger, Jose Pasillas, DJ Kilmore, Ben Kenney
- **Sound:** The most divisive Incubus album. A dramatic shift toward atmospheric, new wave-influenced, and introspective territory. Softer dynamics, prominent keyboards and synthesizers, restrained guitar work, and Boyd's most subdued vocal performances. Largely abandoned the heavier elements that had persisted through Light Grenades.
- **Key tracks:** "Adolescents," "Promises, Promises," "If Not Now, When?," "Isadore," "In the Company of Wolves"
- **Chart:** #2 Billboard 200
- **Significance:** Polarized the fanbase. Some praised the artistic growth; others missed the band's aggressive energy. The five-year gap between Light Grenades and this release was the longest in the band's history at the time. Represented the furthest point of Incubus's sonic evolution away from their roots.

### 8 (2017)

- **Released:** April 21, 2017
- **Label:** Island Records
- **Lineup:** Brandon Boyd, Mike Einziger, Jose Pasillas, DJ Kilmore, Ben Kenney
- **Producer:** Skrillex (Sonny Moore) co-produced several tracks
- **Sound:** A course correction that attempted to balance the atmospheric approach of If Not Now, When? with more energetic rock elements. Electronic production touches from Skrillex's involvement. Shorter, more direct songs than the previous album.
- **Key tracks:** "Nimble Bastard" (#4 Mainstream Rock Songs), "State of the Art," "Loneliest," "Glitterbomb," "No Fun"
- **Chart:** #4 Billboard 200 -- sixth top-five and seventh top-ten entry
- **Significance:** Marked a partial return to more accessible rock territory. The Skrillex collaboration signaled the band's continued interest in bridging rock and electronic music. Six-year gap between albums was their longest to date.

## Musical Analysis -- What Makes Incubus Sound Like Incubus

### Guitar

Mike Einziger's guitar is the band's most distinctive instrumental element. He is fundamentally an effects-driven player -- his enormous pedalboard (which he actively tweaks during live performances) defines the Incubus guitar sound more than any particular riff style. Key characteristics: heavy use of delay (Electro-Harmonix Memory Man, Danelectro Reel Echo), phaser effects (dual Boss PH-2 Super Phasers, MXR Phase 90), ring modulation (DOD Gonkulator), and envelope filter (DOD FX-25). Early career featured funk-metal riffing and wah-heavy lead work; evolved into atmospheric, textured playing that creates space and mood rather than occupying sonic territory with volume and distortion. His split-amp approach (Marshall for drive, Vox AC30 for cleans) allows real-time blending of tones. Multi-instrumentalist contributions (pipa, sitar, Mellotron, synths, Rhodes) further expand the palette.

### Bass

Two distinct eras. **Dirk Lance era (1991--2003):** Aggressive, funky bass playing heavily influenced by Flea and Les Claypool. Slap technique, melodic runs, and a prominent role in the mix. His playing was central to the band's funk-metal identity. **Ben Kenney era (2003--2023):** More understated, groove-oriented approach. Kenney's style served the songs rather than showcasing technique, fitting the band's evolution toward atmospheric rock. The rhythmic foundation shifted from funk-driven to more rock-solid and supportive.

### Drums

Jose Pasillas provides the rhythmic versatility that allows Incubus to shift between genres. His playing ranges from aggressive, driving rock patterns to world-music-influenced polyrhythmic grooves to the more restrained, dynamic approach of the band's atmospheric period. Emphasis on feel and pocket over flash. His elementary-school friendship with Boyd and middle-school connection with Einziger gives the rhythm section an intuitive, deeply ingrained musical communication.

### Turntables and Electronics

DJ Kilmore's role evolved from the turntable scratching and sampling typical of late-1990s nu-metal into something far more integral and unique. By Morning View and beyond, his contributions shifted toward atmospheric synth textures, keyboard pads, electronic layering, and subtle sonic manipulation that became part of the band's identity rather than a gimmick. Incubus is one of the few bands to have a dedicated DJ/electronic musician as a permanent, essential member rather than a touring addition.

### Vocals

Brandon Boyd's voice is Incubus's most immediately identifiable element. His range spans from breathy, intimate low passages to powerful belt and controlled falsetto. Early career: aggressive, rhythmically complex delivery influenced by Mike Patton's unpredictable style. Later career: smoother, more melodic approach with emphasis on sustained lines, emotional dynamics, and a distinctive breathy quality. His ability to shift between intensity and vulnerability within a single song is a core Incubus characteristic. Live, Boyd's charismatic stage presence and djembe playing add visual and sonic energy.

### The Evolution

The defining narrative of Incubus's musical identity is transformation:
- **1995--1997** (Fungus Amongus, S.C.I.E.N.C.E.): Funk-metal with turntables, aggressive and experimental
- **1999--2001** (Make Yourself, Morning View): Melodic alternative rock, atmospheric, dynamic
- **2004--2006** (A Crow Left of the Murder, Light Grenades): Eclectic rock balancing aggression and atmosphere
- **2011--2017** (If Not Now When?, 8): Atmospheric, electronic-influenced, introspective

This wasn't a sudden rebranding -- it was a gradual broadening that incorporated each new influence while retaining core elements (Boyd's voice, Einziger's effects-driven textures, Kilmore's electronic contributions).

### Cited Influences

Faith No More, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Primus, Mr. Bungle, Soundgarden, Rage Against the Machine, Alice in Chains, Tool, Bjork, Jeff Buckley, Ani DiFranco, Stone Temple Pilots, Phish, John Zorn, Led Zeppelin, The Police, Pink Floyd.

## Lyrical Themes

### Introspection and Personal Growth

The dominant Incubus lyrical mode. Boyd's lyrics frequently examine the self -- identity, purpose, personal evolution, the tension between comfort and growth. "Drive" ("Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there") became an anthem of self-determination. "Wish You Were Here," "Warning," and "Dig" explore relationships and emotional honesty with philosophical undertones.

### Spirituality and Philosophy

Boyd's interest in Eastern philosophy, meditation, and spiritual seeking permeates the lyrics without becoming dogmatic. References to consciousness, interconnection, and transcendence appear throughout -- expressed through imagery and metaphor rather than direct preaching. His visual art practice informs a poetic, image-driven lyrical approach.

### Environmentalism

Environmental themes appear throughout the catalog, reflecting Boyd's personal activism. "Clean" from Morning View, the nature imagery in "Aqueous Transmission," and various references to humanity's relationship with the natural world.

### Political Commentary

Less frequent than personal themes but present, particularly on A Crow Left of the Murder. "Megalomaniac" is the most direct political statement -- a critique of unchecked power and authoritarian tendencies that earned the band their only Grammy nomination.

### Relationships

Love, loss, longing, and connection are recurring subjects, but Boyd typically approaches them through abstract imagery and philosophical framing rather than straightforward narrative.

---

## Live Performance

Incubus live shows balance polished musicianship with improvisational energy. The band frequently extends songs with jam sections, and Boyd's djembe playing adds a percussive element not present on studio recordings. Boyd's stage presence is physical and charismatic -- he is known for his athleticism, often performing shirtless and incorporating movement and dance into his delivery.

### Key Tours and Milestones

- **Ozzfest 1999:** Breakthrough exposure on the second stage alongside System of a Down
- **Family Values Tour 1999:** Alongside Korn, Limp Bizkit, and others -- placed them in the nu-metal context they would soon outgrow
- **Headlining arena tours (2001--2006):** Peak commercial touring era
- **Morning View Anniversary Tour (2023--2025):** Performing the album in its entirety at arena venues; introduced new bassist Nicole Row; coincided with the Morning View XXIII re-recording release

## Reference Tracks (Incubus Essential Listening)

### Defining the Sound
- **"Drive"** (Make Yourself, 1999) -- The Incubus song. Acoustic-driven, wistful, with Boyd's most iconic vocal melody. The track that broke them to mainstream audiences and demonstrated how far they'd evolved from funk-metal. #9 Hot 100, #1 Alternative Songs.
- **"Wish You Were Here"** (Morning View, 2001) -- Peak atmospheric Incubus. Warm, layered production with Einziger's textured guitar work and Boyd's emotionally resonant vocal delivery. Captures the Morning View recording environment.
- **"Pardon Me"** (Make Yourself, 1999) -- The bridge between Incubus eras. Heavy verse riff with a soaring, melodic chorus. Shows the band balancing aggression with accessibility.
- **"Nice to Know You"** (Morning View, 2001) -- Explosive album opener with one of Einziger's most recognizable riffs. Demonstrates Incubus at their most energetic and immediate.

### Funk-Metal Era
- **"A Certain Shade of Green"** (S.C.I.E.N.C.E., 1997) -- The definitive early Incubus track. Aggressive funk-metal riffing, turntable scratches, Boyd's rapid-fire delivery, and a massive chorus. Documents the sound they built before the transformation.
- **"New Skin"** (S.C.I.E.N.C.E., 1997) -- Furious energy with genre-blending ambition. Showcases the experimental edge of the S.C.I.E.N.C.E. era.

### Evolution and Range
- **"Megalomaniac"** (A Crow Left of the Murder, 2004) -- Their most politically charged song. Angular, aggressive, and deliberately confrontational. Earned their only Grammy nomination.
- **"Aqueous Transmission"** (Morning View, 2001) -- The most adventurous track in the catalog. Built on Einziger's pipa (Chinese lute) and Okinawan koto over a bed of nature sounds and ambient textures. Closes Morning View and represents the furthest reach of Incubus's sonic exploration -- proof of how far a funk-metal band can travel.

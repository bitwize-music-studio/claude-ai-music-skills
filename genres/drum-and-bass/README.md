# Drum and Bass

## Genre Overview

Drum and Bass (DnB) is a fast-tempo electronic music genre characterized by rapid breakbeats, heavy sub-bass lines, and syncopated rhythms typically ranging from 160-180 BPM. Originating from the UK rave and jungle scenes in the early 1990s, DnB blends elements of hip-hop breakbeats, reggae bass frequencies, and electronic production techniques. The genre is defined by its frenetic energy, intricate drum programming, and emphasis on low-end frequency response. DnB exists on a spectrum from liquid, atmospheric sounds to dark, industrial neurofunk, making it versatile enough for both dancefloor and listening experiences.

## Characteristics

- **Instrumentation**: Breakbeats (170+ BPM), synthesized bass (sub-bass emphasis), atmospheric pads, chopped vocals, drum loops, electronic effects, occasional live instruments in liquid subgenres
- **Vocals**: Often minimal or absent; when present, typically chopped, filtered, or atmospheric. Liquid DnB may feature soulful singing or spoken word over breakbeats
- **Production**: High-pass filters on breakbeats, sidechain compression on bass, reverb/delay effects, pitch-shifted drums, layered synths, complex drum programming with swing
- **Energy/Mood**: High-energy, intense, and aggressive in darker styles; meditative and uplifting in liquid variants; always maintains rhythmic momentum despite fast tempo
- **Structure**: Often builds from stripped-down breaks into full arrangements. Typical song length 3-5 minutes. Drops, breakdowns, and bass line switches create dynamic tension

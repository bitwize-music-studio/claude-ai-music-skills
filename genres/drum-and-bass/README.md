# Drum and Bass

## Genre Overview

Drum and Bass (DnB) is a fast-tempo electronic music genre characterized by rapid breakbeats, heavy sub-bass lines, and syncopated rhythms typically ranging from 160-180 BPM. The genre emerged from the UK rave scene in the early 1990s, growing directly out of the hardcore and jungle movements that dominated illegal warehouse parties and pirate radio stations across London, Bristol, and the Midlands. Producers sampled funk and soul breakbeats, particularly the iconic "Amen break" from The Winstons' 1969 track, chopping and time-stretching them to create the frenetic rhythmic foundation that would define the genre. Early pioneers like Goldie, LTJ Bukem, and A Guy Called Gerald fused these accelerated breaks with deep reggae and dub bass frequencies, creating a distinctly British sound rooted in the multicultural soundsystem culture of inner-city UK.

The evolution from jungle to drum and bass marked a shift toward more refined production techniques and broader sonic experimentation. By the mid-1990s, producers began diverging into distinct camps: the liquid sound championed by LTJ Bukem's Good Looking Records emphasized atmospheric, jazz-influenced textures and soulful vocal samples, while artists like Ed Rush, Optical, and Technical Itch pushed toward darker, more industrial territory that would eventually crystallize into neurofunk. The late 1990s techstep movement, exemplified by labels like Virus and Metalheadz, introduced harder-edged production with sci-fi sound design and dystopian themes. This period established the bifurcation that defines modern DnB: the soulful, melodic liquid end versus the aggressive, bass-heavy dark side.

The 2000s and 2010s saw drum and bass mature into a global phenomenon while remaining rooted in UK club culture. Labels like Hospital Records brought liquid DnB to mainstream audiences with artists like High Contrast, London Elektricity, and Netsky, while Ram Records pushed commercial crossover with Chase & Status and Sub Focus. Simultaneously, the underground continued to evolve through labels like Critical Music, Dispatch, and Metalheadz, developing increasingly sophisticated sound design and minimal arrangements. The genre's influence spread worldwide, with significant scenes emerging in Austria (Camo & Krooked), Belgium (Netsky), and Brazil. Today, drum and bass maintains its dual identity: a dancefloor-focused genre built for sweat-soaked clubs and festival mainstages, while simultaneously offering meditative listening experiences through its more atmospheric variants.

## Characteristics

- **Instrumentation**: Breakbeats (170+ BPM), synthesized bass (sub-bass emphasis), atmospheric pads, chopped vocals, drum loops, electronic effects, occasional live instruments in liquid subgenres
- **Vocals**: Often minimal or absent; when present, typically chopped, filtered, or atmospheric. Liquid DnB may feature soulful singing or spoken word over breakbeats
- **Production**: High-pass filters on breakbeats, sidechain compression on bass, reverb/delay effects, pitch-shifted drums, layered synths, complex drum programming with swing
- **Energy/Mood**: High-energy, intense, and aggressive in darker styles; meditative and uplifting in liquid variants; always maintains rhythmic momentum despite fast tempo
- **Structure**: Often builds from stripped-down breaks into full arrangements. Typical song length 3-5 minutes. Drops, breakdowns, and bass line switches create dynamic tension

## Lyric Conventions

- **Default rhyme scheme**: Minimal — MC/vocal hooks over fast breakbeats.
- **Rhyme quality**: When present (MC style), internal rhyme and rapid-fire delivery. Near rhymes at speed.
- **Verse structure**: Short vocal hooks or MC bars over 170+ BPM breakbeats. Jungle/DnB MC style: rapid, rhythmic.
- **Key rule**: Energy and speed. Vocals must cut through heavy bass and fast drums. Short, punchy, repeatable.
- **Avoid**: Slow, drawn-out vocal passages. Dense lyrics that can't match the tempo.
- **Density/pacing**: high density · 8-14 syl/line · max 2-3 topics/verse · typical BPM 160-180. Fastest electronic genre. MC delivery allows high density despite tempo. Jungle tradition of rapid-fire toasting.

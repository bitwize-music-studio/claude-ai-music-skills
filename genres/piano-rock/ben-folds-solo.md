# Ben Folds — Solo Career Deep Dive

## Overview

Benjamin Scott Folds (born September 12, 1966, Winston-Salem, NC) launched his solo career in 2001 after the amicable dissolution of Ben Folds Five. Where BF5 was a statement about what piano-bass-drums could do without guitar, Folds' solo work expanded in every direction — full-band rock, orchestral arrangements, chamber music, a cappella, collaborations with novelists and actors, a piano concerto, film soundtracks, and a role as Artistic Advisor to the National Symphony Orchestra at the Kennedy Center.

His solo catalog spans eight studio albums (including three collaborative), six live albums, ten compilations, and extensive orchestral touring. He is equally comfortable alone at a piano, fronting a rock trio, performing with a chamber sextet, or soloing against an 83-piece symphony orchestra. The throughline is the piano, the voice, and an unshakable commitment to honest, emotionally specific songwriting delivered with wit, craft, and an increasingly ambitious sense of arrangement.

## Personal Life Context

Understanding Folds' personal life illuminates the music directly — his children, marriages, and geographic moves appear explicitly in the songs.

- **Early life**: Son of a carpenter father (Carlos Dean Folds) and a painter mother (Sylvia Scott Kellam). Began piano at age 9 when his father brought one home through a barter trade. Learned Elton John and Billy Joel by ear from AM radio. Also learned drums, bass, and guitar.
- **Education**: Richard J. Reynolds High School, Winston-Salem. Full percussion scholarship to University of Miami's Frost School of Music (dropped out after failing "the jury"). Also attended UNC-Greensboro.
- **Nashville (first stint, ~1990)**: Music publishing deal brought him to Nashville. Later moved to Montclair, NJ; acted in NYC theater troupes; played weekly gigs at Sin-e (Jeff Buckley's famous cafe). Moved back to North Carolina ~1993 and formed BF5.
- **Five marriages**:
  1. **Anna Goodman (1987-1992)** — Childhood friend from Moore Elementary School, Winston-Salem. Co-wrote several BF5 songs. Folds has called her his "oldest friend."
  2. **Kate Rosen (1996-1997)** — Brief marriage.
  3. **Frally Hynes (1999-2006)** — Australian. Met January 1998, married May 1999 in Adelaide. Twins born July 1999: Louis Francis (inspired "Still Fighting It") and Gracie Scott (inspired "Gracie"). Song "Adelaide" written about the city. Divorced 2006.
  4. **Fleur Stanbrook (2007-2011)** — Married November 17, 2007, at The Venetian, Las Vegas. Based in Nashville.
  5. **Emma Sandall (2017-2024)** — Former Royal Ballet dancer. Married January 20, 2017. Divorced; Folds ordered to pay $475,000 for her interest in shared Nashville home plus monthly payments totaling $650,000 over two years.
- **Nashville (second stint, 2002-present)**: Leased the historic RCA Studio A. Currently resides in Nashville.

## Transition from BF5

Ben Folds Five disbanded amicably in October 2000 after their worldwide tour supporting The Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Messner. The reasons were multifaceted: exhaustion from constant touring, pressure from Sony for another hit album, interpersonal friction from years of creative compromise among three strong personalities, and the commercial disappointment of Reinhold Messner (under 300K copies vs. platinum predecessor).

Folds: "If we weren't enjoying it, I don't really know how we expected to make great music. And if it doesn't seem inspired for any reason, it's time to move on. There was no real discussion."

By late 2000, Folds had moved to Adelaide, Australia, where he married Frally Hynes. He began recording solo material at Krell Studios in Adelaide, playing virtually every instrument himself — a radical departure from the collaborative trio format that defined BF5.

## Solo Studio Albums

### Rockin' the Suburbs (2001)

- **Release date**: September 11, 2001
- **Label**: Epic Records
- **Producer**: Ben Folds (self-produced); Ben Grosse on title track
- **Studios**: Krell Studios (Adelaide, Australia), The Mix Room (Los Angeles), Ben Grosse's House (Los Angeles), Mad Hatter and LAFX (Los Angeles)
- **Multi-instrumentalist approach**: Folds played piano, vocals, keyboards, guitars, bass, and drums on nearly every track. Richard Fortus provided additional guitar on select tracks.
- **Touring band**: Britt "Snuzz" Uzzell (guitar), Millard Powers (bass), Jim Bogios (drums). Powers and Bogios later joined Counting Crows.
- **Track count**: 12 tracks, 48 minutes
- **Chart position**: #42 Billboard 200; #11 Top Internet Albums

The solo debut established two things: Folds was a genuine multi-instrumentalist who didn't need a band, and his songwriting had more range than BF5's format could contain. The album shifts between rock aggression, orchestral balladry, satirical character studies, and gut-punch sincerity.

**Key tracks**:

- **"Rockin' the Suburbs"** — Title track satirizes suburban white male nu-metal angst. A parody of the Korn/Rage Against the Machine era delivered with gleeful self-awareness. Producer Ben Grosse (Filter, Fuel) was credited in liner notes as "Shitty Track Fixer." Features DJ Swamp (Beck's DJ) on computerized beats. Music video directed by "Weird Al" Yankovic. Peaked #28 Billboard Alternative Airplay. Name-checks Michael Jackson, Quiet Riot, Jon Bon Jovi. Later remade with William Shatner for Over the Hedge (2006).
- **"Still Fighting It"** — Bittersweet ode to the pain of growing up, dedicated to son Louis (born July 1999). "Everybody knows it hurts to grow up... and everybody does, it's so weird to be back here." One of his most emotionally resonant songs.
- **"The Luckiest"** — Piano ballad about feeling fortunate to have found one's partner. Spare piano, vulnerable vocal, devastating simplicity. Has become a staple wedding song. "I am the luckiest."
- **"Fred Jones Part 2"** — Sequel to "Cigarette" from Whatever and Ever Amen. A middle-aged man is laid off after decades at the same job. Piano and strings paint the scene with novelistic empathy. "Fred sits alone at his desk in the dark / there's an awkward young shadow that waits in the hall."
- **"Zak and Sara"** — '50s-style pop storytelling. "Sara-with-no-H and Zak-without-a-C." Contrasts Sara (vivid/hallucinatory perceptions) with Zak (grounded but darker).
- **"The Ascent of Stan"** — About selling out. Driving rock energy.
- **"Annie Waits"** — Anxious, propulsive character study.
- **"Not the Same"** — About a friend who had a transformative experience at a party and became a born-again Christian. Features massive choral arrangement in the finale — audiences at live shows sing the three-part harmony.

**Japanese/vinyl bonus**: "Hiro's Song" appears exclusively on vinyl and Japanese CD editions.

### Songs for Silverman (2005)

- **Release date**: April 26, 2005
- **Label**: Epic Records
- **Producer**: Ben Folds (self-produced)
- **Studio**: RCA Studios, Nashville
- **Band**: Jared Reynolds (bass), Lindsay Jamieson (drums) — presented as a new trio
- **String arrangements**: Paul Buckmaster (legendary arranger for Elton John, Bowie, Leonard Cohen)
- **Track count**: 11 tracks
- **Chart position**: #13 Billboard 200 (50,000 first-week copies); #65 UK Albums Chart

A more introspective, refined follow-up. The Nashville move and new trio format gave the album a warmer, more mature sound. Paul Buckmaster's string arrangements added orchestral richness that connected Folds to the Elton John tradition.

**Key tracks**:

- **"Landed"** — Sweeping ballad about relief after turbulence. Lead single, peaked #77 Billboard Hot 100. When the label asked for a single, Folds asked "what Elton John song do you want?" They said "Tiny Dancer." Both songs share arranger Paul Buckmaster.
- **"Gracie"** — Written for his newborn daughter Gracie Scott (born July 1999, companion piece to "Still Fighting It" for son Louis). Tender without being saccharine. "You can't fool me / I saw you when you came out / you got your mama's taste but you got my mouth."
- **"Late"** — Tribute to recently deceased songwriter Elliott Smith. A requiem for a peer.
- **"Bastard"** — Self-lacerating examination of his own faults.
- **"Sentimental Guy"** — Self-deprecating admission of emotional vulnerability.
- **"Time"** — Features "Weird Al" Yankovic on backing vocals.
- **"Trusted"** — Trust and its destruction.
- **"Jesusland"** — Political commentary on red-state America. UK single.

**Deluxe edition**: Bonus DVD in book-style package with 40-page booklet, featuring a 40-minute documentary "The Making of Songs for Silverman."

**Album title**: An in-joke referencing Folds' manager.

### Way to Normal (2008)

- **Release date**: September 30, 2008
- **Label**: Epic Records
- **Producer**: Ben Folds
- **Studios**: Avatar Studios, New York; Quad Studio, New York
- **Band**: Jared Reynolds (bass), Sam Smith (drums)
- **Instruments**: Piano, Moog synthesizer, Wurlitzer, mellotron, vocals
- **Track count**: 12 tracks
- **Chart position**: #11 Billboard 200 (40,000 first-week copies) — highest-charting solo album at the time

A return to rock energy after Silverman's introspection. More aggressive, more playful, and the source of one of the most creative anti-piracy stunts in music history.

**The Fake Leak**: In July 2008, while in Dublin for the Oxegen Festival, Folds booked 24 hours of studio time with Reynolds and Smith. They spent 8 hours recording deliberately fake versions of 6 tracks. The fake file (bundled with 6 real rough tracks) was anonymously posted on fan sites on July 16, 2008. Forum moderators initially deleted it, fearing legal backlash. Debate raged online until August 12 when Folds admitted on Triple J radio that many tracks were fake, followed by a track-by-track breakdown in Rolling Stone on August 13. Some fans actually preferred the fake versions, and Folds began getting requests to play fake tracks live. All 9 fake tracks were later released on Stems and Seeds (2009).

**Key tracks**:

- **"You Don't Know Me" (feat. Regina Spektor)** — Lead single. A duet where Spektor added spontaneous vocal ideas beyond the planned part. Music video directed by Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim (Tim & Eric). Folds "just called her up and we went up and did it."
- **"Cologne"** — About long-distance lovers trying to let go. iTunes bonus: piano/orchestra version.
- **"Before Cologne"** — Short interlude. Later used in Honda Accord and iPhone 4S commercials.
- **"Hiroshima (B B B Benny Hit His Head)"** — Surreal, manic opener.
- **"Bitch Went Nuts"** — Provocative title, character-driven dark comedy.
- **"Effington"** — Fictional utopia. Light, catchy, unexpectedly moving.

**Stems and Seeds (2009)**: A remastered, resequenced reissue of Way to Normal released as a response to the "loudness war." Two-disc set: Disc 1 had stem files for GarageBand remixing; Disc 2 had the remastered album plus all fake leak tracks, a live "You Don't Know Me" from Conan O'Brien with Regina Spektor, and a Japanese-language "Hiroshima."

### Lonely Avenue (2010) — with Nick Hornby

- **Release date**: September 28, 2010
- **Label**: Nonesuch Records
- **Producer**: Ben Folds
- **Arranger**: Paul Buckmaster (strings)
- **Credits**: All lyrics by Nick Hornby; all music by Ben Folds
- **Studio**: Folds' studio (RCA Studio A), Nashville — recorded live to 2-inch tape
- **Mastering**: Direct Metal Master process at Abbey Road Studios; pressed at Pallas Manufacturing, Germany
- **Track count**: 11 tracks, 44 minutes
- **Chart position**: #17 Billboard 200

A unique concept album: novelist Nick Hornby (High Fidelity, About a Boy, Fever Pitch) wrote all the lyrics, Folds set them to music. Hornby would email lyrics; Folds composed music and made minimal adjustments for singability. The collaboration produced character-driven storytelling — Hornby's forte as a novelist — married to Folds' melodic gifts.

**How it happened**: Their friendship traced to 2002 when Hornby included BF5's "Smoke" in his essay collection Songbook. During a 2009 dinner, they conceived the album idea. Hornby left all musical decisions to Folds — e.g., he envisioned "Practical Amanda" as upbeat, but Folds made it a gentle ballad.

**Key tracks**:

- **"Levi Johnston's Blues"** — About the Palin-family figure. Satirical, specific, funny.
- **"Belinda"** — Aging pop singer reprising one hit. Hornby's empathy for fading celebrity.
- **"Picture Window"** — Mother with sick child in London hospital on New Year's Eve. Devastating.
- **"Doc Pomus"** — Reimagining of the crippled Brill Building songwriter circa 1962.
- **"From Above"** (first single) — Guest vocals by Kate Miller-Heidke. Animated video directed by Julius Pretite of The Simpsons.
- **"Saskia Hamilton"** — Named after the poet.
- **"Claire's Ninth"** — A child's birthday party.

**Deluxe edition**: Hardbound 152-page book with CD, four Hornby short stories, and 15 photographs by Joel Meyerowitz.

### So There (2015) — with yMusic

- **Release date**: September 11, 2015
- **Label**: New West Records
- **Producers**: Ben Folds, Rob Moose, CJ Camerieri, Elliot Scheiner (concerto)
- **Studio**: Grand Victor Sound (historic RCA Studio A), Nashville
- **Structure**: 8 chamber pop songs + 1 three-movement piano concerto (21 minutes)
- **yMusic members**: Rob Moose (violin), CJ Camerieri (trumpet), Gabriel Cabezas (cello), Alex Sopp (flute), Hideaki Aomori (clarinet), Nadia Sirota (viola)
- **Chart positions**: #10 Billboard 200 (career peak); #1 Billboard Classical Albums; #1 Classical Crossover Albums; #44 Billboard 200; #63 UK Albums Chart

The most ambitious album of Folds' career. Eight songs recorded with the New York-based chamber sextet yMusic, plus a full piano concerto performed with the 83-piece Nashville Symphony Orchestra.

**Notable production choices**: Folds deliberately left out bass on the yMusic tracks, calling it "exciting" and "a philosophical, musical one — what does bass stand for?" Arrangements were three-way collaborations between Moose, Camerieri, and Folds, with wind scoring that mimicked synthesizer sounds through unconventional arpeggios between bass clarinet and piccolo.

**Key tracks**:

- **"Capable of Anything"** — Opens the album. Flips the uplifting expression on its head — being "capable of anything" means also being capable of giving into darkness. "All the fire of 'The Ascent of Stan,' with half of the audial clutter."
- **"Phone in a Pool"** — Lead single (July 2015). Inspired by losing his phone in a pool; Kesha dove in fully clothed to retrieve it and told him to put it in rice. Originally cut as a "drunken pub record" in Dublin, then re-recorded with yMusic. NPR called it the album's highlight.
- **"Not a Fan"** — Intimate string and piano writing.
- **"Yes Man"** — Lush chamber pop.
- **"Long Way to Go"** — Adapted from a coda on the fake leak version of "Way to Normal."

**The Piano Concerto**: Jointly commissioned by the Nashville Ballet, Nashville Symphony, and Minnesota Orchestra. Three movements, 21 minutes. Premiered 2014 by the Nashville Symphony; conductor Giancarlo Guerrero. Pays homage to Gershwin and Copland; some passages verge into dissonant, arrhythmic territory. Folds composed with a copyist who helped orchestrate, acting almost as a producer. For preparation, he spent 18 months immersed in scores by Rachmaninov, Bartok, Ravel, and Gershwin. Folds described a concerto as "a tug-of-war, almost a fight, like a dance-off" between piano and orchestra.

---

## RCA Studio A

One of the most important creative decisions of Folds' solo career was leasing Nashville's historic **RCA Studio A** (30 Music Square West) beginning in 2002.

- **Discovery**: Found it by chance while driving around Nashville — saw a "Studio Available" sign and pulled in
- **Live room**: 75 x 45 feet with 25-foot ceiling — the largest studio room in Nashville when built, designed for recording large groups live
- **Gear**: Late-'70s MCI JH-16 tape machine (reconditioned), countless tube mics, ADAM S3A monitors, 1954 Collins 212-A tube broadcast mixer (left behind by producer Scott Litt), API console
- **Approach**: For the first 5 years, it was essentially Folds' personal workspace — "a giant man cave for a quirky, somewhat geeky mad genius musician-type"
- **Analog philosophy**: Lonely Avenue was recorded on 2-inch tape and designed to be listened to on vinyl. Mastered at Abbey Road Studios using Direct Metal Master process.
- **Preservation**: In 2014, the building was threatened with demolition for condominiums. Folds spearheaded a grassroots campaign. Curb Records founder Mike Curb and philanthropists Chuck Elcan and Aubrey Preston collectively purchased the building for $5.6 million, preserving it as a working studio.

---

## Production Style Evolution

### From BF5 to Solo

The shift from BF5 to solo work involved several major changes:

- **BF5**: Collaborative trio. Piano, bass, drums only. Occasional string/horn overdubs. The sound was defined by what was absent (guitar) as much as what was present.
- **Rockin' the Suburbs (2001)**: One-man-band approach. Folds played virtually every instrument — piano, guitars, bass, drums, keyboards. Guitar appeared freely. The "no guitar" ideology was a BF5 statement, not a personal one.
- **Songs for Silverman (2005)**: New trio format (Reynolds on bass, Jamieson on drums) plus Paul Buckmaster's orchestral string arrangements. More refined, introspective production.
- **Way to Normal (2008)**: Return to rock energy with Reynolds and Sam Smith. Moog, Wurlitzer, mellotron added to the piano palette.
- **Lonely Avenue (2010)**: Recorded to 2-inch tape. Analog warmth, vinyl-era production philosophy. Paul Buckmaster strings.
- **So There (2015)**: Chamber sextet (yMusic) plus full symphony. No bass on the pop tracks. Most ambitious production and arrangement.
- **What Matters Most (2023)**: Co-produced with Joe Pisapia. Return to intimate, album-arc-focused approach.

### Voice Leading & Arranging Philosophy

- Uses staff paper for vocal arrangements to track voice leading against the piano: "I don't like the sound of bad voice leading and dumpy harmony"
- On So There, deliberately removed bass: "What does bass stand for? As a foundation?"
- yMusic arrangements scored winds in unconventional ways — arpeggios between bass clarinet and piccolo that mimicked synthesizer sounds
- Increasingly comfortable writing for orchestra, drawing on classical study (Rachmaninov, Bartok, Ravel, Gershwin)

## Reference Tracks (Solo Essential Listening)

### The Solo Debut
- **"Rockin' the Suburbs" (2001)** — Title track satirizes suburban malaise with humor and driving piano. Bridges piano rock and piano pop.
- **"Still Fighting It" (2001)** — Father-to-son tenderness without sentimentality. "Everybody knows it hurts to grow up."
- **"The Luckiest" (2001)** — One of the great modern love songs. No irony, no wit, just vulnerability. "I am the luckiest."
- **"Fred Jones Part 2" (2001)** — Novelistic empathy in miniature. Piano and strings paint a layoff.
- **"Not the Same" (2001)** — Builds to a massive choral finale that audiences perform live.

### The Mature Years
- **"Landed" (2005)** — Soaring ballad about relief after turbulence. Melodically irresistible. Paul Buckmaster strings.
- **"Gracie" (2005)** — Written for his daughter. Tender, specific, real.
- **"Late" (2005)** — Elliott Smith elegy. Quiet, devastating.
- **"You Don't Know Me" feat. Regina Spektor (2008)** — Duet with spontaneous chemistry. Two piano rock icons together.
- **"Cologne" (2008)** — Long-distance heartbreak rendered in delicate piano and strings.

### The Collaborations
- **"Levi Johnston's Blues" (2010)** — Hornby's satirical specificity meets Folds' melodic wit.
- **"Picture Window" (2010)** — Hospital room on New Year's Eve. Hornby's most devastating lyric.
- **William Shatner — "Common People" (2004)** — Pulp cover with Joe Jackson. Shatner's spoken-word over Folds' arrangement somehow works brilliantly.

### The Chamber & Orchestral Work
- **"Capable of Anything" (2015)** — yMusic chamber arrangement. Flips "capable of anything" to dark implications.
- **"Phone in a Pool" (2015)** — yMusic pop-rock. Anxious song about communication breakdown.
- **Piano Concerto, Movement 1 (2015)** — Gershwin meets Bartok. Classical crossover that earned #1 on Billboard Classical.

### The Return
- **"Winslow Gardens" (2023)** — Lead single from What Matters Most. Mature, reflective.
- **"Moments" feat. Tall Heights (2023)** — Album closer. Collaborative, warm.

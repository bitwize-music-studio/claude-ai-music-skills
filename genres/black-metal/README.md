# Black Metal

## Genre Overview

Black metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal characterized by shrieked or high-pitched vocals, tremolo-picked guitar riffs, blast beat drumming, and intentionally lo-fi or raw production aesthetics. Emerging from Scandinavia in the early 1990s, black metal represents a deliberate rejection of commercial polish in favor of atmospheric dread, raw aggression, and anti-establishment ethos. The genre spans from minimalist kvlt traditions to symphonic arrangements, uniting artists through an uncompromising approach to sonic extremity and thematic darkness.

## Characteristics

- **Instrumentation**: Distorted guitars (tremolo picking), blast-beat drumming, bass (often inaudible), synthesizers/keyboards (atmospheric), minimal leads
- **Vocals**: Shrieked or high-pitched screams, often processed or layered; some subgenres incorporate clean singing or spoken passages
- **Production**: Intentionally lo-fi or raw; thin, distorted tone; drums pushed high in mix; guitars buried; often DIY/bedroom recorded
- **Energy/Mood**: Relentless intensity, atmospheric dread, nihilistic, furious, hypnotic repetition, corpse paint aesthetics
- **Structure**: Long tremolo passages, minimal verse/chorus distinction, repetitive riffing designed for meditative trance rather than accessibility

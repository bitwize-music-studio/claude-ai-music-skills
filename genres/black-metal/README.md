# Black Metal

## Genre Overview

Black metal emerged from the primordial darkness of 1980s extreme metal, but its second wave in early 1990s Norway transformed it into something unprecedented: a genre defined as much by ideology, aesthetics, and infamy as by its sound. While first-wave pioneers like Venom, Bathory, and Celtic Frost established the template of raw aggression and Satanic imagery, it was the Norwegian scene that crystallized black metal into a coherent artistic movement with its own visual identity, philosophical underpinnings, and tragic notoriety.

The Norwegian second wave coalesced around Mayhem's Euronymous and his Helvete record shop in Oslo, which became the gathering point for musicians who would define the genre: Varg Vikernes (Burzum), Fenriz and Nocturno Culto (Darkthrone), Samoth and Ihsahn (Emperor), and Abbath and Demonaz (Immortal). These artists rejected the technical proficiency and production values of death metal in favor of deliberately primitive recording techniques, viewing lo-fi production as authentic expression rather than limitation. The resulting "necro" sound, with its trebly guitars, buried vocals, and thin drum tones, became the genre's sonic signature.

The scene's infamy stemmed from real-world violence: a series of church arsons across Norway between 1992-1996, the murder of Mayhem's Euronymous by Burzum's Varg Vikernes, and the suicide of Mayhem vocalist Dead. While these events brought unwanted mainstream attention, they also cemented black metal's reputation as extreme music's most uncompromising corner, a reputation the genre has both cultivated and complicated in the decades since.

Beyond Norway, black metal rapidly globalized while fragmenting into diverse subgenres. Swedish bands like Marduk and Dark Funeral pursued relentless speed and aggression. Finnish acts like Beherit and Impaled Nazarene added industrial and punk influences. The French scene (Blut aus Nord, Deathspell Omega) brought avant-garde experimentation and philosophical depth. American bands like Weakling and Wolves in the Throne Room developed the atmospheric and post-black metal variants. Today, black metal encompasses everything from the most primitive kvlt worship to progressive compositions that push boundaries while maintaining the genre's core commitment to atmospheric extremity and ideological intensity.

## Characteristics

### Sonic Elements
- **Instrumentation**: Heavily distorted guitars (tremolo picking primary technique), bass (often inaudible or following guitar lines), drums (blast beats, double bass), synthesizers/keyboards (atmospheric, orchestral, or ambient textures), minimal lead guitar work
- **Tunings**: Standard E (traditional), Drop D, occasionally lower (modern variants); higher tunings preferred for trebly tone
- **Guitar Tone**: Thin, buzzing, trebly distortion; deliberately harsh and abrasive; scooped mids; "wall of sound" tremolo approach
- **Drums**: Blast beats (essential), double bass, minimalist fills, often triggered or raw depending on production approach

### Vocal Approaches
- **Shrieked/Screamed**: The signature black metal vocal, high-pitched, raspy, tortured; often processed with reverb
- **Growled**: Lower register, borrowed from death metal, used in some blackened death crossover
- **Clean**: Chanted, whispered, or sung; used for atmospheric contrast (Ulver, Enslaved)
- **Layered**: Multiple vocal tracks creating choir-like or demonic effects

### Production Specifics
- **Lo-Fi/Raw**: Intentionally primitive recording, often home or rehearsal space recordings; thin guitar tone, drums high in mix, vocals buried or drenched in reverb
- **Atmospheric**: More polished but still dark; layers of synths and guitars creating immersive soundscapes
- **Symphonic**: Full production with orchestral elements, cleaner but maintaining darkness
- **Modern/Clean**: Contemporary production techniques while preserving genre aesthetics

### Tempo & Structure
- **BPM Ranges**:
  - Atmospheric/DSBM: 60-120 BPM (slower, meditative)
  - Traditional Norwegian: 140-200 BPM (blast sections)
  - War metal: 200-280 BPM (relentless)
  - Post-black/blackgaze: 100-160 BPM (dynamic variation)
- **Song Lengths**: 4-8 minutes typical; atmospheric and progressive variants often 10-20+ minutes
- **Structure**: Minimal verse-chorus distinction; repetitive tremolo passages designed for hypnotic effect; gradual dynamic builds; sudden shifts between blast sections and atmospheric passages; extended instrumental sections

### Thematic Content
- **Anti-Christianity/Satanism**: Rejection of Abrahamic religion, Satanic imagery (symbolic or literal), church burning references
- **Nature/Paganism**: Norse mythology, nature worship, anti-modern sentiment, environmental themes
- **Nihilism/Misanthropy**: Rejection of humanity, cosmic insignificance, existential despair
- **Depression/Suicide**: DSBM's focus on self-destruction, isolation, and mental anguish
- **War/Violence**: Militaristic themes, historical warfare, apocalyptic imagery
- **Occultism**: Esoteric philosophy, Thelema, chaos magick, left-hand path spirituality

### Visual Aesthetics
- **Corpse Paint**: Black and white face paint, originated with King Diamond/Celtic Frost, codified by Norwegian scene
- **Band Photos**: Forests, winter landscapes, ruins, candlelit interiors
- **Album Art**: Medieval imagery, Romantic paintings, forests, religious desecration, minimalist designs
- **Typography**: Illegible logo design as artistic statement, often symmetrical and resembling tree branches

## Lyric Conventions

- **Default rhyme scheme**: Optional — atmosphere and imagery dominate over rhyme structure.
- **Rhyme quality**: Poetic and archaic language valued. Internal rhyme and alliteration more common than end rhyme.
- **Verse structure**: Variable — through-composed structures common. No pop conventions required.
- **Key rule**: Nature imagery (forests, mountains, winter), mythology, paganism, anti-religious themes. Archaic or folkloric vocabulary. Transporting the listener to another world.
- **Avoid**: Modern/mundane imagery. Pop song structures. Literal or prosaic language.
- **Density/pacing**: moderate-high density · 8-14 syl/line · max 2-4 topics/verse · typical BPM 130-200. Atmospheric passages alternate with blasts. Shrieked vocals obscure syllables — keep imagery vivid despite delivery.

| Bathory | 1983-2004 | Sweden | *The Return* (1985), *Under the Sign of the Black Mark* (1987), *Blood Fire Death* (1988) | Quorthon single-handedly created first-wave black metal AND Viking metal. Early albums were raw Satanic aggression; later work pioneered epic, folk-influenced metal. Foundational influence on both waves. |
| Enslaved | 1991-present | Norway | *Vikingligr Veldi* (1994), *Below the Lights* (2003), *Axioma Ethica Odini* (2010) | Progressive Viking black metal evolution. Early albums defined Norse black metal; later work incorporated prog rock, psychedelia, and clean vocals while maintaining roots. One of black metal's most respected acts. |
| Dissection | 1989-2006 | Sweden | *The Somberlain* (1993), *Storm of the Light's Bane* (1995), *Reinkaos* (2006) | Melodic black/death metal perfection.

| Deathspell Omega | 1998-present | France | *Si Monumentum Requires, Circumspice* (2004), *Fas - Ite, Maledicti, in Ignem Aeternum* (2007), *Paracletus* (2010) | Avant-garde black metal's most acclaimed act. Theistic Satanism, dissonant riffing, and complex theological themes. The trilogy beginning with *Si Monumentum* redefined black metal's intellectual possibilities. |
| Wolves in the Throne Room | 2003-present | USA | *Two Hunters* (2007), *Black Cascade* (2009), *Thrice Woven* (2017) | American atmospheric black metal leaders. Cascadian scene's nature worship and environmentalism channeled through hypnotic, extended compositions. Female vocals and folk elements add ethereal dimension. |
| Alcest | 2000-present | France | *Souvenirs d'un Autre Monde* (2007), *Ecailles de Lune* (2010), *Kodama* (2016) | Neige created blackgaze, fusing black metal tremolo with shoegaze dreaminess. Childhood memories of a "fairy land" provide thematic content. Clean vocals and ethereal atmosphere dominate later work. |
| Xasthur | 1995-2010 | USA | *Nocturnal Poisoning* (2002), *Subliminal Genocide* (2006), *Defective Epitaph* (2007) | Malefic's solo DSBM project defined American depressive black metal. Layers of distorted guitars, buried vocals, and suffocating atmosphere create overwhelming despair. Disbanded to pursue acoustic music. |
| Mgla | 2000-present | Poland | *Exercises in Futility* (2015), *Groza* (2008), *Age of Excuse* (2019) | Modern black metal's critical darlings. M.'s philosophical nihilism, Darkside's precise drumming, and memorable riffs prove traditional black metal can still innovate. Exercises in Futility is a modern classic. |

## Reference Tracks

For style reference when prompting:

### Norwegian Second Wave Foundation
- **Mayhem - "Freezing Moon" (1994)**: The definitive Norwegian black metal song. Euronymous' haunting tremolo riff, Dead's desperate vocals (recorded before his suicide), and an atmosphere of genuine dread that remains unmatched. The blueprint for everything that followed.
- **Burzum - "Dunkelheit" (1996)**: Atmospheric black metal's founding statement. Varg's hypnotic, repetitive approach reduces metal to its meditative essence. The whispered German lyrics and synth pads create isolation and cold. Philosophem's minimalism influenced countless atmospheric bands.
- **Darkthrone - "Transilvanian Hunger" (1994)**: Pure kvlt distilled to its essence. Four minutes of relentless tremolo picking over blast beats, Nocturno Culto's distant screams, and production so raw it sounds like a transmission from another dimension. The most imitated black metal song ever recorded.
- **Emperor - "I Am the Black Wizards" (1994)**: Symphonic black metal's pinnacle. Ihsahn's swirling keyboards, Faust's precise blast beats, and layers of tremolo guitars create orchestral chaos. The ambition to merge classical grandeur with black metal aggression succeeded beyond all expectations.
- **Immortal - "Blashyrkh (Mighty Ravendark)" (1995)**: Abbath's croaked vocals narrate the fantasy realm of Blashyrkh over relentless blasting. The epic scope and almost playful energy set Immortal apart from their peers' grim seriousness while maintaining genuine intensity.

### Atmospheric & Progressive
- **Wolves in the Throne Room - "I Will Lay Down My Bones Among the Rocks and Roots" (2007)**: American atmospheric black metal's defining moment. Eighteen minutes of cascading tremolo, female vocals, and nature worship building to cathartic release. The Cascadian scene's manifesto.
- **Enslaved - "Isa" (2004)**: Progressive black metal evolution. Clean vocals, psychedelic passages, and complex arrangements prove black metal can grow without abandoning its roots. Grutle Kjellson's harsh vocals contrast with Herbrand Larsen's clean singing.
- **Blut aus Nord - "Procession of the Dead Clowns" (2003)**: Avant-garde black metal's unsettling masterwork. Industrial rhythms, dissonant guitars, and an atmosphere of cosmic horror. The Work Which Transforms God redefined what black metal could achieve.

### Depressive & Blackgaze
- **Xasthur - "Prison of Mirrors" (2002)**: DSBM's suffocating essence. Layers of distorted guitars, effects-buried vocals, and an atmosphere of absolute despair. Malefic's solo vision created overwhelming psychological weight from minimal means.
- **Alcest - "Ecailles de Lune, Part 1" (2010)**: Blackgaze perfection. Neige's tremolo picking serves ethereal beauty rather than aggression. Clean vocals, shoegaze textures, and childhood nostalgia create something genuinely transcendent from black metal's building blocks.
- **Deafheaven - "Dream House" (2013)**: Blackgaze's controversial crossover moment. Kerry McCoy's tremolo riffs and George Clarke's screams over post-rock dynamics brought black metal to new audiences. Polarizing but undeniably influential.

### Modern Excellence
- **Mgla - "Exercises in Futility I" (2015)**: Modern black metal's critical triumph. M.'s nihilistic philosophy, memorable riffs, and Darkside's impeccable drumming prove traditional black metal can still innovate. The opening track of a modern classic album.
- **Deathspell Omega - "Chaining the Katechon" (2004)**: Avant-garde black metal's theological depth. Dissonant riffing, complex song structures, and Mikko Aspa's tormented vocals serve themes of theistic Satanism and divine absence. Intellectually demanding extreme music.

### First Wave & Foundations
- **Bathory - "A Fine Day to Die" (1988)**: The bridge between first-wave black metal and Viking metal. Quorthon's epic composition begins with acoustic guitar before erupting into battle hymn grandeur. Blood Fire Death pointed toward metal's future while honoring its past.
- **Celtic Frost - "Circle of the Tyrants" (1985)**: First-wave black metal's most influential band. Tom G. Warrior's "Ugh!" grunts, avant-garde ambition, and crushing heaviness created the template that Norwegian bands would refine. To Mega Therion remains essential.

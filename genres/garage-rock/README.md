# Garage Rock

## Genre Overview

Garage rock is a raw, energetic rock subgenre defined by simplicity, DIY aesthetics, and unpolished authenticity. Emerging in the 1960s from garage bands playing simple chord progressions and fuzzy guitars, garage rock celebrates the power of straightforward songwriting, distorted tones, and high-energy performance. The genre rejects over-production in favor of genuine energy, vocal attitude, and the thrill of the three-minute pop-rock song delivered with maximum intensity. Garage rock has experienced multiple revivals—from the punk-influenced garage bands of the 1970s to the 2000s garage rock revival (The White Stripes, The Strokes)—and remains a foundational influence on punk, grunge, and indie rock.

## Characteristics

- **Instrumentation**: Electric guitar (heavily distorted or fuzzy), bass, drums, sometimes keyboards or organ. Minimal but impactful arrangements emphasizing the guitar riff.
- **Vocals**: Raw, rough-edged delivery with attitude. Often conversational or shouted rather than smooth. Emphasis on attitude over technical perfection.
- **Production**: Lo-fi, recorded live in single takes or with minimal overdubs. Distortion, fuzz, and tape saturation embraced as aesthetic choices rather than flaws.
- **Energy/Mood**: High-octane, restless, youthful urgency. Defiant attitude, sometimes gritty or menacing. Celebration of raw power and simplicity.
- **Structure**: Often built on simple, catchy riffs and chord progressions. Short songs (2-3 minutes) with tight arrangements. Emphasis on immediate impact over complexity.

# PHONK

## Genre Overview

Phonk is a contemporary hip-hop subgenre that synthesizes the dark, chopped samples of Memphis rap with lo-fi production aesthetics, hypnotic beat structures, and visual culture inspired by Japanese street racing and drift videos. Emerging in the early 2010s and gaining mainstream attention through TikTok and YouTube, phonk combines nostalgic '90s rap elements with modern electronic production. The genre's aesthetic is characterized by moody, atmospheric soundscapes, pitched vocal samples, and repetitive beat patterns designed for hypnotic effect. Phonk has become the dominant soundtrack for car customization videos, gaming content, and youth culture, transcending music to become a complete visual and lifestyle movement.

## Characteristics

- **Instrumentation**: Chopped and pitched Memphis rap samples, analog synthesizers, cowbell patterns, trap snares, 808 bass drums, vintage horror movie strings, occult/mystical vocal chops, distorted guitars (in aggressive variants)
- **Vocals**: Pitched rap samples, eerie vocal chops, layered and reversed vocals, minimalist spoken-word passages, often instrumental or sample-based rather than traditional singing
- **Production**: Heavy sampling, heavy reverb and delay, lo-fi tape compression, minor-key melodies, hypnotic looping, minimal arrangement with maximum atmosphere, often 60-90 BPM range
- **Energy/Mood**: Dark, moody, atmospheric, hypnotic, meditative yet intense, mysterious, edgy, rebellious, sometimes aggressive or menacing, nostalgic with modern edge
- **Structure**: Repetitive 4-8 bar loops, minimal evolution, hypnotic builds, sudden drops, often instrumental with sparse vocal interjections, typically 2-5 minutes long

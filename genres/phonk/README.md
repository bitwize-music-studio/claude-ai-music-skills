# PHONK

## Genre Overview

Phonk is a contemporary hip-hop subgenre rooted in the dark, lo-fi aesthetic of 1990s Memphis rap, synthesizing chopped vocal samples, hypnotic beat structures, and heavy bass with visual culture inspired by Japanese street racing and drift videos. The genre traces its lineage directly to Memphis pioneers like Three 6 Mafia, DJ Zirk, Tommy Wright III, and Koopsta Knicca, whose occult imagery, chopped samples, and tape-saturated production established the sonic DNA that phonk producers would revive decades later. These Memphis originators created music that was deliberately lo-fi, sampling horror films and obscure soul records, layering eerie synthesizers over booming 808s, and delivering lyrics steeped in street violence and supernatural themes.

The evolution from underground Memphis rap to modern phonk occurred in distinct waves. In the early 2010s, producers like SpaceGhostPurrp and the Raider Klan collective began explicitly reviving and recontextualizing the Memphis sound, blending it with cloud rap aesthetics and internet-era distribution. This "OG phonk" or "Memphis revival" era emphasized authenticity to the source material: heavy sample chopping, vintage tape compression, and dark spirituality. By the mid-2010s, a new variant emerged: "drift phonk," which stripped the genre to its most hypnotic elements, added aggressive cowbell patterns, and optimized the sound for viral car videos. Producers like Ghostface Playa, PHARMACIST, and Kordhell crafted tracks specifically designed for the dopamine loop of YouTube shorts and TikTok, creating an inseparable link between the music and visual content.

Modern phonk has exploded into mainstream consciousness, becoming the dominant soundtrack for car customization, gaming montages, fitness content, and youth culture globally. The genre has fragmented into numerous subgenres: aggressive phonk incorporates metal and hardstyle elements; Brazilian phonk fuses the sound with funk carioca rhythms; ethereal phonk emphasizes ambient textures and spiritual themes. Despite this diversification, phonk maintains its core identity through signature elements: pitched Memphis rap vocals, 808-heavy production, hypnotic repetition, and an aesthetic that romanticizes nocturnal street culture, Japanese car modification, and outsider identity. The genre transcends music to function as a complete lifestyle brand, with distinctive visual language, fashion associations, and community norms that distinguish it from other hip-hop subgenres.

## Characteristics

- **Instrumentation**: Chopped and pitched Memphis rap samples, analog synthesizers, cowbell patterns (especially in drift phonk), trap snares and hi-hats, 808 bass drums, vintage horror movie strings, occult/mystical vocal chops, distorted guitars (in aggressive variants), reversed cymbal swells, vinyl crackle layers
- **Vocals**: Pitched rap samples (typically pitched down but sometimes up), eerie vocal chops, layered and reversed vocals, minimalist spoken-word passages, often instrumental or sample-based rather than traditional singing; heavy use of Three 6 Mafia and Tommy Wright III vocal samples in authentic productions
- **Production**: Heavy sampling from 1990s Memphis rap catalogs, heavy reverb and delay, lo-fi tape compression and saturation, minor-key melodies, hypnotic looping, minimal arrangement with maximum atmosphere, sidechain compression for pumping effect, deliberate degradation and bit-crushing for vintage aesthetic
- **Energy/Mood**: Dark, moody, atmospheric, hypnotic, meditative yet intense, mysterious, edgy, rebellious, sometimes aggressive or menacing, nostalgic with modern edge; energy ranges from trance-like cruising to adrenaline-pumping aggression depending on subgenre
- **Structure**: Repetitive 4-8 bar loops, minimal evolution, hypnotic builds, sudden drops, often instrumental with sparse vocal interjections, typically 2-5 minutes long; drift phonk specifically engineered for short-form video formats
- **Tempo**: Typically 130-160 BPM with half-time feel creating perceived tempo of 65-80 BPM; faster aggressive variants can reach 170+ BPM; slower Memphis-style tracks often sit at 60-80 BPM actual tempo

## Lyric Conventions

- **Default rhyme scheme**: End rhyme with internal rhyme chains. Near rhyme (family rhymes) common.
- **Rhyme quality**: Cadenced and loose. Attitude over polish.
- **Verse structure**: Short — repetitive, hypnotic, and subtle. Mood first, then detail.
- **Key rule**: Dark, atmospheric mood drives everything. Night drives, nostalgia, graveyard shift.
- **Avoid**: Overwriting. Dense wordplay that fights the hypnotic groove.
- **Density/pacing (Suno)**: Default **4 lines/verse** (2 couplets) at 60-80 BPM. Memphis phonk is slow — Suno has very little time per line. Drift phonk (130-170 BPM): 4-6 lines but often instrumental. Topics: 1/verse max.

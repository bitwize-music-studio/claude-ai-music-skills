## Reference Tracks

### Enya
- "Orinoco Flow (Sail Away)" (Watermark, 1988) — The breakthrough single; built on the Roland D-50 "Pizzagogo" preset, layers of vocals creating an oceanic wash; #1 UK
- "Only Time" (A Day Without Rain, 2000) — Most recognizable song; piano-led with gentle vocal layers building to lush choral texture; became an anthem of reflection after 9/11
- "Caribbean Blue" (Shepherd Moons, 1991) — Dreamy, flowing, vocal layering at its most seductive; effortless beauty masking extraordinary production complexity
- "Boadicea" (Enya / The Celts, 1987) — Dark, hypnotic, built almost entirely from layered vocals; later sampled by The Fugees on "Ready or Not"
- "Watermark" (Watermark, 1988) — Piano-led instrumental showcasing the production aesthetic in its purest form; delicate, meditative, shimmering synth textures
- "Storms in Africa" (Watermark, 1988) — Originated from the Roland Juno-60's arpeggiator; rhythmically driven with pulsing synth arpeggios beneath vocal layers
- "May It Be" (The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, 2001) — Incorporating Elvish language; Academy Award and Golden Globe nominated; Celtic-ambient meets epic fantasy
- "Book of Days" (Shepherd Moons, 1991) — Featured in Far and Away; exists in English and Irish Gaelic versions; more rhythmically assertive than typical
- "Anywhere Is" (The Memory of Trees, 1995) — More accessible, pop-structured with a memorable melodic hook; top ten UK
- "Wild Child" (A Day Without Rain, 2000) — Upbeat and rhythmically propulsive by Enya's standards; lighter, more playful side of the sound

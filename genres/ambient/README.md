# Ambient

## Genre Overview

Ambient music is a genre of electronic and instrumental music characterized by atmospheric, textural soundscapes that prioritize tone, atmosphere, and timbre over traditional song structure, melody, or rhythm. Originating in the 1970s with Brian Eno's "Music for Airports," ambient music is designed to create immersive sonic environments that can range from deeply meditative and calming to unsettling and immersive. The genre serves as a canvas for abstract emotion, environmental narrative, and sonic experimentation, often blurring the lines between music and sound design.

## Characteristics

- **Instrumentation**: Synthesizers, field recordings, drones, pads, processed acoustic instruments, found sounds, reverb-heavy layering
- **Vocals**: Minimal or absent; when present, typically processed, textural, or purely phonetic (wordless)
- **Production**: Emphasis on effects (reverb, delay, modulation), layering, slow evolution, minimalism, lo-fi aesthetics, sound design
- **Energy/Mood**: Contemplative, meditative, atmospheric, introspective, sometimes haunting or unsettling; low to moderate dynamic range
- **Structure**: Non-linear; emphasis on texture and atmosphere over verse/chorus form; long sustain periods; gradual builds over minutes

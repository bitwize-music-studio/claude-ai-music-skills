# Dropkick Murphys --- Deep Dive

## Overview

The Dropkick Murphys are an American Celtic punk band formed in 1996 in Quincy, Massachusetts, in the basement of a friend's barbershop. Founded by bassist/vocalist Ken Casey, guitarist Rick Barton, and vocalist Mike McColgan, the band was named after John "Dropkick" Murphy, a WWII-era osteopath, professional wrestler, and alcohol rehabilitation facility owner from Acton, Massachusetts. What began as a lark between friends who had never been in a band became one of the most enduring and commercially successful acts in punk rock history, with thirteen studio albums and millions of records sold worldwide.

The band's identity is inseparable from Boston. Ken Casey grew up in Milton, Massachusetts, raised by his grandfather John Kelly, a teamster and union organizer on the Boston waterfront. Casey's earliest memories include running the bases at Fenway Park after Red Sox games --- his grandfather knew the cops detailed for games and was friends with Boston legend Johnny Pesky. That blue-collar, Irish-American, sports-obsessed, fiercely loyal-to-your-neighborhood ethos permeates every Dropkick Murphys record. They are not a band that happens to be from Boston; Boston is the band's reason for existing.

Musically, the Dropkick Murphys fuse hardcore punk aggression with traditional Irish and Celtic folk instrumentation --- bagpipes, tin whistle, mandolin, accordion, banjo, and bouzouki layered over driving punk guitars, pounding drums, and gang vocal choruses designed for crowd participation. Their earliest material drew from Oi!, street punk, and Boston hardcore, but by their third album the Celtic instrumentation became central to their identity. Ken Casey has described their goal as being "the AC/DC of Celtic punk rock" --- a band that perfects and refines a specific sound rather than reinventing itself. Their main influence is the Belfast punk band Stiff Little Fingers, with acknowledged debts to the Ramones, the Pogues, and the Clash.

The Dropkick Murphys have been known for supporting working-class and union causes throughout their career, maintaining a strong relationship with the AFL-CIO. All merchandise sold by the band is 100% union-made in the United States. Casey's grandfather was a union organizer, and his father-in-law retired as president of Local 1421, one of the last demolition locals in the country. Before forming the band, Casey himself worked as a union laborer specializing in demolition. This is not an aesthetic --- it is autobiography.

- **Role in band:** Primary songwriter, co-lead vocalist, and the band's only constant member since formation. Originally played bass and sang; transitioned to full-time vocalist after a 2018 motorcycle/construction accident caused nerve damage in his right hand and neck surgery. He lost all feeling in his right hand but went on tour five days after surgery, unable to play bass, so he started just singing. Kevin Rheault took over bass duties.
- **Equipment:** Left-handed Fender Precision Basses through Ampeg SVT bass amplifiers and cabinets

### Al Barr --- Lead Vocals (1998--present; on hiatus since 2022)

- **Born:** January 21, 1968, Hanover, New Hampshire

- **Vocal style:** Grittier and more aggressive than McColgan's delivery. His vocal interplay with Casey --- trading verses and sharing choruses --- became the band's signature dynamic. Described as bringing "brutal growls" and making "the band sound totally different, more edgy and more angry."
- **Hiatus:** In February 2022, Barr stepped away from touring to care for his mother, who is battling Lewy Body Dementia. The hiatus has extended through 2024, with Casey taking over full vocal duties.

- **Drumming style:** Driving, punchy, aggressive punk drumming with enough finesse to handle the band's constant stylistic shifts --- from blast-speed punk to Celtic folk passages. Influenced by rock drummers John Bonham, Phil Rudd, and Ian Paice, and jazz musicians Art Blakey, Joe Morello, Max Roach, and Philly Joe Jones.
- **Equipment:** Custom emerald green acrylic drum kit (8x12 rack, 14x14 and 16x16 floors, 20x22 kick, 6.5x14 snare) with Celtic symbol wood badges on claw-style wood hoops. DW 5000 kick pedal, Zildjian cymbals.

### James Lynch --- Rhythm Guitar, Lead Guitar, Backing Vocals (2000--present)

- **Background:** Former member of the Ducky Boys, a Boston punk band
- **Joined DKM:** 2000, during the major lineup overhaul following Rick Barton's departure. Joined alongside Marc Orrell, Ryan Foltz, and Spicy McHaggis.
- **Role:** Rhythm and lead guitar. One of the band's longest-serving members alongside Casey and Kelly.

### Tim Brennan --- Lead Guitar, Accordion, Tin Whistle, Mandolin, Bouzouki, Keyboards, Piano, Vocals (2003--present)

- **Born:** West Hartford, Connecticut
- **Background:** Played drums for numerous punk, hardcore, and rock bands in Connecticut before attending Assumption University in Worcester, MA. A high school teacher gave him a Pogues cassette tape, which inspired him to learn the tin whistle. The same teacher later gave him *Do or Die*, fully introducing him to Celtic punk.
- **Joining DKM:** In 2003, asked to join the band on the Warped Tour to sell merchandise. While on tour, they had him play accordion on a few songs. When the Warped Tour ended, he went back to college, but a month later the mandolin player left and the band asked him to join full time as their accordion/mandolin/tin whistle/banjo player.
- **Transition to lead guitar:** When Marc Orrell departed in 2008, Brennan became lead guitarist while continuing to play accordion and tin whistle on all recordings.
- **Instruments:** Tin whistle, accordion, mandolin, bouzouki, keyboard, piano, vocals, and lead guitar. Uses Roland gear for keyboard/accordion sounds in live settings.
- **Significance:** Brennan is one of the band's primary songwriters and the member most responsible for the Celtic instrumentation that defines their modern sound.

### Jeff DaRosa --- Banjo, Bouzouki, Mandolin, Guitar, Harmonica, Tin Whistle, Keyboards, Vocals (2008--present)

- **Background:** Former member of The Vigilante and Pinkerton Thugs, both Boston-area punk bands
- **Joined DKM:** 2008, taking over Tim Brennan's previous multi-instrumentalist duties when Brennan moved to lead guitar after Marc Orrell's departure
- **Instruments:** Banjo, bouzouki, mandolin, guitar, keyboard, piano, harmonica, tin whistle, and vocals
- **Equipment:** Has his own signature banjo --- the Dropkick Murphys Deering Banjo, made by Deering. Describes it as the instrument he is most proud of. Looks at the bouzouki as "just a bigger mandolin" because he strings it the same way; usually uses it for droning, noting it "almost sounds like a 12-string in a way."
- **Recording technique:** The band found that bagpipes need to be triple-tracked to sound good --- one sounds thin, two sound out of tune, but three creates a "weird phasing thing" that sounds "really cool."

### Kevin Rheault --- Bass (c. 2020--present)

- **Joined DKM:** Took over bass duties when Ken Casey transitioned to full-time vocalist following his 2018 injury

### Campbell Webster --- Bagpipes, Uilleann Pipes (current)

- **Role:** Current bagpiper for the band, handling the signature Celtic pipe sounds in live and studio settings

- **Label:** Hellcat Records
- **Producer:** Lars Frederiksen (Rancid)
- **Lineup:** Mike McColgan (vocals), Ken Casey (bass/vocals), Rick Barton (guitar), Matt Kelly (drums)
- **Sound:** Raw, aggressive punk with early Irish folk elements --- bagpipes, tin whistle, and a cover of the traditional "Finnegan's Wake" alongside original songs. Heavily influenced by Oi!, street punk, and Boston hardcore. Described as "a culmination of Irish-inspired folk and Boston punk rock that put the Dropkick Murphys on the map." At a time when a lot of American punk was aimed at suburban teens, the Dropkicks came with painfully earnest songs about traditional values and civic pride.
- **Key tracks:** "Barroom Hero," "Boys on the Docks," "Finnegan's Wake," "Do or Die"
- **Significance:** The only album featuring original vocalist Mike McColgan, who left mid-tour shortly after release to become a Boston firefighter. The band's only full release with the founding lineup. Considered one of the best punk albums of the 1990s.

### The Gang's All Here (1999)

- **Released:** March 9, 1999
- **Label:** Hellcat Records
- **Producer:** Lars Frederiksen
- **Lineup:** Al Barr (vocals), Ken Casey (bass/vocals), Rick Barton (guitar), Matt Kelly (drums)
- **Sound:** First album with Al Barr on vocals, introducing the vocal interplay between Barr and Casey that would define the band going forward. More mature songwriting than the debut while retaining the aggressive punk foundation. The exchanges between the two vocalists became the group's signature.
- **Key tracks:** "The Gang's All Here," "10 Years of Service," "The Gauntlet"
- **Significance:** Proved the band could survive a vocalist change. Barr's grittier vocal style pushed the band toward a more aggressive sound.

### Sing Loud, Sing Proud! (2001)

- **Released:** February 6, 2001
- **Label:** Hellcat Records
- **Sound:** The album that cemented the Celtic punk identity. More instrumentation than previous efforts, with the band growing into a septet. Incorporated mandolin, tin whistle, accordion, and bagpipes as core elements rather than occasional accents. The first Murphys album not produced by Lars Frederiksen. Features guest vocals from Shane MacGowan (The Pogues) on "Good Rats" and Colin McFaull (Cock Sparrer).
- **Key tracks:** "Good Rats" (feat. Shane MacGowan), "The Wild Rover," "The Spicy McHaggis Jig," "For Boston"
- **Lineup changes:** The final release featuring founding guitarist Rick Barton, who left early into recording and only appears on three tracks. The band added James Lynch and 17-year-old Marc Orrell on guitars, mandolin player Ryan Foltz, and bagpiper Spicy McHaggis.
- **Significance:** Defined the Dropkick Murphys' signature sound. The expansion from a four-piece punk band to a multi-instrument Celtic punk outfit was now complete.

### Blackout (2003)

- **Released:** June 10, 2003
- **Label:** Hellcat Records
- **Sound:** Continued refining the Celtic punk formula. Featured new bagpipe player Scruffy Wallace and accordionist Tim Brennan joining the lineup. Casey took over more vocal duties, solidifying the dual-vocalist dynamic. Included the minor radio hit "Walk Away" and fan favorite "Fields of Athenry" (a reworked traditional Irish song).
- **Key tracks:** "Walk Away," "Fields of Athenry," "Worker's Song," "Gonna Be a Blackout Tonight," "Buried Alive"
- **Significance:** Introduced Tim Brennan (who would become a central member) and Scruffy Wallace on bagpipes. "Worker's Song" --- a reworked 1979 Ed Pickford folk classic --- became a signature labor anthem for the band.

### The Warrior's Code (2005)

- **Released:** June 21, 2005
- **Label:** Hellcat Records
- **Sound:** The band's commercial breakthrough and bestselling album. A dedication to Lowell boxer "Irish" Micky Ward, whose working-class tenacity and fighting spirit embodied the band's ethos. Balanced hard-charging Celtic punk anthems with the Woody Guthrie collaboration "I'm Shipping Up to Boston."
- **Key tracks:** "I'm Shipping Up to Boston," "The Warrior's Code," "Sunshine Highway," "Captain Kelly's Kitchen"
- **"I'm Shipping Up to Boston":** Built around four lines of lyrics Ken Casey found in Woody Guthrie's archives, set to a rollicking accordion melody. Originally released on *Give 'Em the Boot IV* (2004) and re-recorded for this album. Became the band's signature song after being featured in Martin Scorsese's *The Departed* (2006). Certified Platinum. Used in the title track of the 2010 film *The Fighter* (the Micky Ward biopic).
- **Significance:** Their final record on Hellcat Records. The album that took them from punk underground to mainstream cultural force, largely on the back of one Woody Guthrie lyric.

### The Meanest of Times (2007)

- **Released:** September 18, 2007
- **Label:** Born & Bred Records (a division of Cooking Vinyl Records)
- **Sound:** The band's first release on their own label. Perhaps energized by the response to "I'm Shipping Up to Boston" and *The Departed*, the album has some of the best songs of the Al Barr era. Celtic instrumentation --- banjo, mandolin, tin whistle, accordion, bagpipes --- used to kick the songs up a notch without slowing them down. The energy is infectious, with bagpipes and accordions giving it a "swashbuckling, beer-chugging sound." Last album to feature guitarist Marc Orrell.
- **Key tracks:** "The State of Massachusetts," "Johnny, I Hardly Knew Ya," "(F)lannigan's Ball," "Fairmount Hill," "Famous for Nothing"
- **Chart performance:** Debuted at #20 on the Billboard 200 (28,000 first-week copies). Ranked #49 on Rolling Stone's Top 50 Albums of 2007.
- **Significance:** "The State of Massachusetts" became one of their most enduring songs --- a narrative about family, addiction, and state intervention delivered with anthemic Celtic punk energy.

### Going Out in Style (2011)

- **Released:** March 1, 2011
- **Label:** Born & Bred Records
- **Producer:** Ted Hutt
- **Sound:** A concept album telling the story of Cornelius Larkin, a fictional Irish immigrant character whose journey traces from immigration hardships in early 20th-century America through manual labor, Korean War service, and eventual defiant death amid a raucous funeral wake. The liner notes feature an obituary for Larkin written by author Michael Patrick MacDonald. The album balances the band's hardest-charging punk with their most ambitious storytelling.
- **Guest appearances:** Bruce Springsteen, Fat Mike (NOFX), Chris Cheney (The Living End), comedian Lenny Clarke
- **Key tracks:** "Going Out in Style," "Peg o' My Heart," "Sunday Hardcore Matinee," "Memorial Day"
- **Chart performance:** Debuted at #6 on the Billboard 200 --- the highest chart position in Dropkick Murphys history.
- **Significance:** Their most conceptually ambitious work. AllMusic noted that while pop/rock's pantheon of concept characters is topped by Ziggy Stardust and Tommy, Cornelius Larkin would likely outfight and outdrink them both.

### Signed and Sealed in Blood (2013)

- **Released:** January 8, 2013
- **Label:** Born & Bred Records
- **Sound:** Full-throated punk anthems balanced with sly, reflective storytelling. Apple Music described the Dropkick Murphys as balancing "full-throated punk bacchanals with surprising subtlety." The album features "Rose Tattoo," which became one of their most popular and emotionally resonant songs, alongside "The Season's Upon Us," a darkly comic Christmas song about dysfunctional family gatherings.
- **Key tracks:** "Rose Tattoo," "The Season's Upon Us," "The Boys Are Back," "Prisoner's Song"
- **Chart performance:** Debuted at #9 on the Billboard 200.
- **Significance:** "Rose Tattoo" became a concert staple and one of the definitive Celtic punk ballads --- acoustic verses building to a full-band chorus, dedicated to departed loved ones.

### 11 Short Stories of Pain & Glory (2017)

- **Released:** January 6, 2017
- **Label:** Born & Bred Records
- **Sound:** The band's first album recorded outside Massachusetts, with the entire creative process relocated to El Paso, Texas. Thematically influenced by the band's work with the Claddagh Fund, addressing addiction recovery, children's welfare, and veterans' issues. First album since *Blackout* without bagpiper Scruffy Wallace (who left in 2015).
- **Key tracks:** "Blood," "First Class Loser," "Paying My Way," "4-15-13" (about the Boston Marathon bombing)
- **Chart performance:** Debuted at #8 on the Billboard 200, their second-highest debut behind *Going Out in Style*.
- **Significance:** Demonstrated the band could work outside their Boston comfort zone while staying true to their sound.

### Turn Up That Dial (2021)

- **Released:** April 30, 2021
- **Label:** Born & Bred Records
- **Producer:** Ted Hutt
- **Sound:** A return to Celtic punk and straight-up punk roots after *11 Short Stories* experimented with genres outside their core sound. Every song is either Celtic punk or straight-up punk, resulting in a much more consistent album. The first album where Casey does not play bass at all (following his 2018 injury), with the new dynamic of roaming the front of the stage sparking new energy.
- **Key tracks:** "Middle Finger," "Queen of Suffolk County," "Good As Gold," "Mick Jones Stole My Pudding" (inspired by a real incident in which the Clash guitarist accidentally stole a dessert from the band's producer)
- **Chart performance:** Generally well-received. Kerrang! wrote it "won't dethrone 2005's career-defining *The Warrior's Code*, but it's a welcome hug."
- **Significance:** The last album featuring both Casey and Barr on vocals before Barr's hiatus. Marked 25 years of the Dropkick Murphys.

### This Machine Still Kills Fascists (2022)

- **Released:** September 30, 2022
- **Label:** Dummy Luck Music
- **Producer:** Ted Hutt
- **Sound:** The band's first acoustic album, composed entirely of previously unpublished lyrics and words by Woody Guthrie, set to original music by the band. Recorded at the legendary Church Studio in Tulsa, Oklahoma (Leon Russell's studio), in Guthrie's home state. The title references Guthrie's famous guitar sticker "This Machine Kills Fascists." An entirely different sonic palette for the band --- acoustic instruments, no electric distortion --- but the rowdy Dropkick Murphys energy persists.
- **Nora Guthrie:** Woody's daughter gave the band access to unpublished lyrics. She served as executive producer, noting the band's longstanding commitment to workers' rights gave them credibility in utilizing her father's words and legacy.
- **Key tracks:** "Two 6's Upside Down," "Cadillac, Cadillac," "All You Fonies"
- **Significance:** First studio album since *Do or Die* to not feature vocalist Al Barr (on hiatus). Demonstrated the Dropkick Murphys-Woody Guthrie connection was not limited to "I'm Shipping Up to Boston." Solidarity with the working class is a recurring theme in both bodies of work.

### Okemah Rising (2023)

- **Released:** May 12, 2023
- **Label:** Dummy Luck Music
- **Producer:** Ted Hutt
- **Sound:** Recorded during the same 2022 Tulsa sessions as *This Machine Still Kills Fascists*, using more of Guthrie's unpublished lyrics. Features a reworked "Tulsa Version" of "I'm Shipping Up to Boston" --- bringing the song full circle to Guthrie's original words. More eclectic than its predecessor, with guest appearances from Violent Femmes, Jaime Wyatt, Jesse Ahern, and Woody's grandson Cole Quest.
- **Key tracks:** "I'm Shipping Up to Boston (Tulsa Version)," "Okemah Rising," "Never Git Drunk No More"
- **Significance:** Named for Okemah, Oklahoma, Woody Guthrie's birthplace. The two Guthrie albums together comprise 22 songs and represent the most sustained artistic collaboration between a living band and a deceased songwriter's archive.

### For the People (2025)

- **Released:** July 4, 2025 (streaming); October 10, 2025 (CD/LP)
- **Label:** Dummy Luck Records
- **Producer:** Ted Hutt
- **Sound:** A return to full-band electric Celtic punk, described as reflecting "the band's entire ethos" and showing "courage and confidence, speaking up against the injustices happening in the United States." Features the return of Al Barr on one track ("The Vultures Circle High"), plus guest appearances by Billy Bragg, The Scratch, and Mary Wallopers. Album cover by Shepard Fairey's Studio Number One.
- **Key tracks:** "Who'll Stand With Us?," "Chesterfields and Aftershave" (about Casey's memories of his grandfather), "A Hero Among Many" (about Welles Crowther, the 9/11 hero known as "the Man in the Red Bandanna"), "The Vultures Circle High" (feat. Al Barr), "The Big Man"
- **Chart performance / promotion:** A free show in Quincy, MA, drew approximately 10,000 fans. Expanded Edition features 17 songs (vs. 12 on streaming).
- **Significance:** Their thirteenth studio album. Barr's return, even for a single track, was the highlight for long-term fans --- it makes "the band sound totally different, more edgy and more angry."

## Musical Analysis --- What Makes the Dropkick Murphys Sound Like the Dropkick Murphys

### The Punk Foundation

The rhythmic backbone is pure punk: fast tempos often exceeding 160 BPM, driving drums with snare-heavy attack, distorted electric guitars playing power chord progressions, and a heavy bass anchoring the rhythm. The early albums (*Do or Die*, *The Gang's All Here*) drew heavily from Oi!, street punk, and Boston hardcore --- fast, aggressive, stripped-down. This punk skeleton never left, even as the band layered Celtic instrumentation on top.

### The Celtic Layer

What separates the Dropkick Murphys from every other punk band is the traditional instrumentation woven into the punk framework:

- **Bagpipes:** Soaring, reedy melodies that cut through distorted guitars. The band triple-tracks bagpipes in the studio --- one sounds thin, two sound out of tune, but three creates a "weird phasing thing" that sounds powerful. Used for anthemic hooks, emotional peaks, and marching energy.
- **Tin whistle (penny whistle):** Piercing, folk-derived hooks that interweave with guitar riffs. Tim Brennan plays tin whistle on all recordings.
- **Accordion:** Rhythmic chugs and harmonic fills that add Celtic texture. Central to songs like "I'm Shipping Up to Boston."
- **Mandolin:** Folk authenticity and rhythmic drive. Both Brennan and DaRosa play mandolin.
- **Banjo:** Twangy accents and driving rhythmic accompaniment. Jeff DaRosa has his own signature Deering banjo.
- **Bouzouki:** Droning chords that DaRosa describes as sounding "almost like a 12-string."

The critical point: these instruments play *alongside* the punk instruments, not in alternation. Fiddle and distorted guitar harmonize simultaneously; tin whistle cuts through loud guitars; accordion pumps alongside power chords. This layered approach creates an anthemic, communal atmosphere.

### Vocal Style

- **Dual vocals:** The interplay between Ken Casey and Al Barr (or previously Mike McColgan) is central to the sound. They trade verses, share choruses, and create a call-and-response dynamic.
- **Gang vocals:** Shouted group choruses are the band's signature. Every member contributes backing vocals. The gang vocal chorus is often the most memorable part of any Dropkick Murphys song --- designed for thousands of audience members to join in.
- **Delivery:** Gritty, shouted verses in a street-punk vein, emphasizing working-class bravado. Not technically polished --- emotionally direct and raw. Boston accents are part of the identity.
- **Range:** Spans from intimate, almost whispered acoustic passages to full-throated screaming, with emotional storytelling clarity maintained throughout.

### Production Evolution

- **Early era (1998--2001):** Raw, aggressive punk production. Lars Frederiksen (Rancid) produced the first two albums, giving them a Hellcat Records punk sound.
- **Middle era (2003--2013):** Fuller, more polished production as Celtic instrumentation became central. More dynamic range allowing for quiet-loud contrasts. Instrument balance shifted to give tin whistle, accordion, and bagpipes prominent space in the mix.
- **Ted Hutt era (2011--present):** Hutt became their primary producer starting with *Going Out in Style*. Cleaner, more powerful mixes that maintain live energy while handling the complexity of a seven-piece band with multiple acoustic instruments. The Tulsa sessions (*This Machine Still Kills Fascists*, *Okemah Rising*) showed Hutt could also capture the band in stripped-down acoustic form.

### Structural Approach

Most Dropkick Murphys songs follow a fairly direct verse-chorus-verse structure with gang vocal choruses, but they frequently incorporate:
- Celtic instrumental breaks (bagpipe or tin whistle solos replacing guitar solos)
- Acoustic intros that build to full-band explosions
- Traditional Irish melody quotations woven into original compositions
- Tempo shifts between driving punk and folk-ballad passages within a single song
- Extended singalong codas designed for live performance

### Cited Influences

Stiff Little Fingers (primary), the Ramones, the Pogues, the Clash, AC/DC (for the philosophy of sticking to your sound). The band has also covered traditional Irish songs ("Fields of Athenry," "Johnny, I Hardly Knew Ya," "Finnegan's Wake"), Ed Pickford ("Worker's Song"), and Eric Bogle ("The Green Fields of France"), connecting their punk energy to the folk tradition.

---

## Lyrical Themes

### Working-Class Identity and Labor Solidarity

The most consistent theme across all thirteen albums. Songs about manual labor, union organizing, blue-collar neighborhoods, and economic struggle. "Worker's Song," "Take 'Em Down," "Tomorrow's Industry." Not abstract politics --- personal and familial. Casey's grandfather was a union organizer; Casey himself worked demolition. The band's relationship with the AFL-CIO is longstanding and genuine.

### Boston and Neighborhood Pride

Quincy, South Boston, Dorchester, Milton --- specific neighborhoods and streets appear throughout the catalog. Boston sports teams are referenced constantly. The band's identity is hyperlocal: they are from these neighborhoods, and the songs are for the people who live there.

### Irish-American Heritage

Immigration stories, Celtic traditions, Irish rebel songs reimagined as punk anthems, the immigrant experience in America. Not romanticized --- the albums address the hardships, discrimination, and sacrifices of Irish immigrants alongside the celebrations and cultural pride.

### Memorial and Tribute

Songs honoring departed friends, family members, and heroes. The Irish wake tradition --- celebrating the dead with music, stories, and drink --- is central to the band's emotional palette. "Rose Tattoo," "Going Out in Style" (the entire concept album), "Jimmy Collins' Wake," "A Hero Among Many."

### Defiance and Anti-Authoritarianism

Punk's rebellious spirit applied to working-class and immigrant struggles. Anti-fascist, anti-racist, pro-union. Amplified dramatically on the Woody Guthrie collaborations and *For the People* (2025). The band has never shied from political stances, even at the cost of fans.

### Drinking Culture

Pub songs, toasts, and celebrations --- but often with an undercurrent of addiction awareness. Casey's own 30+ years of sobriety gives the drinking songs a complicated, self-aware quality. The Irish pub as communal space, not just a place to get drunk.

### Sports

Boxing (Micky Ward tribute on *The Warrior's Code*), Red Sox history ("Tessie," "Jimmy Collins' Wake"), Boston sports culture as expression of neighborhood identity and working-class pride.

---

## Cultural Impact

### Boston Sports Anthem

The Dropkick Murphys' relationship with Boston sports is unique in American music. No other band has become so thoroughly identified with a city's sports culture:

- **"I'm Shipping Up to Boston"** became the walk-up song of Red Sox closer Jonathan Papelbon, who danced an Irish jig to it during the 2007 World Series Championship victory parade while the band played on the same float. The song is played at virtually every Boston sporting event. When Papelbon signed with the Philadelphia Phillies in 2012, the band declared he could no longer use the song --- it was "a Boston song."
- **Boston Red Sox:** The band has performed at Red Sox games three times --- 2004, 2007, and 2013 --- and all three times the Sox won the World Series. The song is used to pump up the crowd before playoff games.
- **Boston Bruins:** Use "I'm Shipping Up to Boston" to signal a power play.
- **New England Patriots:** Featured in a 2009 Visa commercial; frequently played during home games.
- **Boston Celtics:** Employed the song during their 2008 playoff run.
- **"Tessie" (2004):** The band revived this song (originally sung by the Royal Rooters fan club that helped the Boston Americans win the 1903 World Series), with backing vocals from Red Sox players Bronson Arroyo, Johnny Damon, and Lenny DiNardo. It became the new theme song of the Boston Red Sox.

### The Departed and Mainstream Breakthrough

Martin Scorsese's use of "I'm Shipping Up to Boston" in his 2006 Academy Award-winning film *The Departed* transformed the Dropkick Murphys from a beloved punk band into a cultural phenomenon. The single was certified Platinum. The song has since appeared in commercials, video games, and an episode of *The Simpsons*. It is used internationally: walk-on music for St. Kilda Football Club in the AFL, entrance music for Ireland and Connacht Rugby in rugby union.

### Woody Guthrie Collaboration

The Dropkick Murphys' relationship with Woody Guthrie's legacy extends far beyond "I'm Shipping Up to Boston." In 2022, Guthrie's daughter Nora gave the band access to unpublished lyrics her father never set to music, resulting in two full albums (*This Machine Still Kills Fascists* and *Okemah Rising*) and a documentary (*This Machine Rising*, released August 2024). The collaboration was validated by closing commentary from Tom Morello and Billy Bragg --- two artists with deep connections to Guthrie's legacy and working-class music. The connection is philosophical: both Guthrie and the Dropkick Murphys build their art on solidarity with the working class.

### The Claddagh Fund

Founded by Ken Casey in 2009 in Boston, named for the three attributes of the Claddagh Ring --- Friendship, Love, and Loyalty. The charity supports underfunded nonprofits serving children, veterans, and addiction recovery programs. Casey is hands-on, personally delivering checks and volunteering with organizations the fund supports. The foundation has directly helped over 200 Boston residents receive mental health counseling, childcare, basic needs, and educational services. The band's work with the Claddagh Fund influenced the themes of *11 Short Stories of Pain & Glory* (2017).

### Labor Movement

- **All merchandise 100% union-made in the United States**
- **"Take 'Em Down" (2011):** Released in support of Wisconsin workers' rights during the 2011 collective bargaining fight. The band worked with the AFL-CIO, SEIU, and AFSCME, making the song available for solidarity rallies nationwide.
- **"Tomorrow's Industry" music video (2010):** Created in collaboration with Boston hospital workers campaigning to join Local 1199 of the SEIU --- the first national recording artists in the US to adopt a labor organizing cause as the main theme of a rock music video.
- **UK Rail Workers (2023):** Shot a music video in collaboration with the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers supporting rail strikes.
- **Newton Teachers' Strike (2024):** Performed "Worker's Song" in solidarity with striking teachers.
- **North Dakota AFL-CIO:** Performed for working people in Fargo, with amps adorned with "UNION YES" signs.

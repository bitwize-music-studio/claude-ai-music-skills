# Vaporwave

## Genre Overview

Vaporwave is an internet-born electronic music genre that emerged in the early 2010s, characterized by slowed and chopped-up samples from 1980s and 1990s sources—corporate hold music, mall elevators, smooth jazz, synthpop, and video game soundtracks. Often presented with nostalgic or ironic aesthetics, vaporwave simultaneously celebrates and critiques consumer capitalism, digital culture, and the hollow commercialism of the late 20th century. The genre blends lo-fi production sensibilities with atmospheric experimentation, creating dreamlike soundscapes that feel both nostalgic and unsettling.

## Characteristics

- **Instrumentation**: Sampled loops (smooth jazz, synth pads, corporate music), vintage synthesizers, drum machines, lo-fi percussion, often heavily processed and layered
- **Vocals**: Minimal or absent; when present, typically heavily processed, chopped, or pitched; rarely conventional singing
- **Production**: Lo-fi aesthetic (intentional noise, tape degradation, pitch shifting), heavy use of reverb and delay, ambient textures, samples often slowed to 50-70% original speed
- **Energy/Mood**: Contemplative, melancholic, dreamlike, ironic nostalgia; ranges from meditative and introspective to unsettling and dystopian
- **Structure**: Often ambient and non-linear; tracks may lack traditional verse-chorus structure, instead building atmospherically or through repetition with subtle evolution

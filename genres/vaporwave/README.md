# Vaporwave

## Genre Overview

Vaporwave is an internet-born electronic music genre that emerged in the early 2010s, characterized by slowed and chopped-up samples from 1980s and 1990s sources—corporate hold music, mall elevators, smooth jazz, synthpop, and video game soundtracks. Often presented with nostalgic or ironic aesthetics, vaporwave simultaneously celebrates and critiques consumer capitalism, digital culture, and the hollow commercialism of the late 20th century. The genre blends lo-fi production sensibilities with atmospheric experimentation, creating dreamlike soundscapes that feel both nostalgic and unsettling.

The genre's foundational moment came with Vektroid's 2011 release "Floral Shoppe" under the alias Macintosh Plus, particularly the track "Lisa Frank 420 / Modern Computing." By slowing Diana Ross's "It's Your Move" to a hypnotic crawl and wrapping it in deteriorated audio artifacts, Vektroid created a template that would define the genre. The album's cover—a glitching bust of Helios, Japanese text, pixelated palm trees, and corporate pastels—established the visual language that would become inseparable from the music. Distributed freely through Bandcamp and Tumblr, Floral Shoppe demonstrated how internet platforms could birth entire aesthetic movements outside traditional music industry channels.

Vaporwave quickly transcended music to become a broader aesthetic movement encompassing visual art, fashion, and internet culture. The genre's visual vocabulary—Roman busts, Japanese characters, Windows 95 interfaces, neon grids, and VHS tracking errors—reflected its sonic preoccupations with memory, decay, and the artificiality of consumer culture. Critics debate whether vaporwave critiques capitalism or simply aestheticizes it, but this ambiguity is central to the genre's appeal. By the mid-2010s, vaporwave had splintered into numerous subgenres while influencing mainstream artists and spawning related movements like synthwave and lo-fi hip-hop. Though often declared "dead," vaporwave continues to evolve, with artists pushing into more experimental territory while preserving the genre's core fascination with nostalgia, technology, and the half-remembered promises of late capitalism.

## Characteristics

- **Instrumentation**: Sampled loops (smooth jazz, synth pads, corporate music), vintage synthesizers, drum machines, lo-fi percussion, often heavily processed and layered
- **Vocals**: Minimal or absent; when present, typically heavily processed, chopped, or pitched; rarely conventional singing
- **Production**: Lo-fi aesthetic (intentional noise, tape degradation, pitch shifting), heavy use of reverb and delay, ambient textures, samples often slowed to 50-70% original speed
- **Energy/Mood**: Contemplative, melancholic, dreamlike, ironic nostalgia; ranges from meditative and introspective to unsettling and dystopian
- **Structure**: Often ambient and non-linear; tracks may lack traditional verse-chorus structure, instead building atmospherically or through repetition with subtle evolution

## Lyric Conventions

- **Default rhyme scheme**: N/A — primarily sampled and chopped vocal loops.
- **Rhyme quality**: Irrelevant — vocals are usually slowed-down, pitched samples, not original writing.
- **Verse structure**: Short, slowed-down phrases continuously repeated as ghostly loops.
- **Key rule**: If writing original vocals: keep it short, dreamy, and designed to be slowed/chopped. Consumer culture critique through aesthetic.
- **Avoid**: Original dense lyrics. Conventional delivery. Fighting the sample-based aesthetic.

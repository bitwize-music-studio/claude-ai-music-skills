# House

## Genre Overview

House music emerged from the underground clubs of Chicago in the early 1980s, born from the creative collision of disco, electronic experimentation, and Black and queer nightlife culture. The Warehouse nightclub, where DJ Frankie Knuckles held residency from 1977-1982, gave the genre its name and spiritual home. Knuckles, along with Ron Hardy at the Music Box, pioneered a sound built on extended disco edits, drum machine rhythms, and imported European electronic tracks from Kraftwerk, Giorgio Moroder, and Italo disco producers. The defining moment came in 1984 when Jesse Saunders released "On and On," widely considered the first house record, followed by Chip E.'s "Time to Jack" and Farley "Jackmaster" Funk's "Love Can't Turn Around." These tracks established the 4/4 kick drum foundation, synthesizer-driven melodies, and soulful vocal samples that would define the genre.

The second wave of house exploded in the late 1980s when UK audiences discovered Chicago imports. The 1987-1989 "Second Summer of Love" transformed British youth culture as acid house - characterized by the squelchy TB-303 bassline pioneered by Phuture's "Acid Tracks" (1987) - fueled massive illegal raves and warehouse parties. UK producers developed their own variations: the soulful UK garage scene, the stripped-down minimal approach, and the euphoric piano-driven sound that dominated charts. Meanwhile, Detroit's techno pioneers like Derrick May and Kevin Saunderson blurred the lines between house and techno, creating soulful machine music that influenced both genres. By the early 1990s, house had fragmented into dozens of subgenres: the deep, jazzy sounds of Masters At Work in New York; the progressive epic builds of Sasha and Digweed; the filtered disco of French touch; and the aggressive electro house emerging from European festivals.

Today, house music stands as the foundational genre of global dance culture, with an estimated market presence spanning from underground warehouse parties to stadium-filling festivals. The genre's evolution continues through tech house's hypnotic minimalism, tropical house's breezy accessibility, and future house's modern pop sensibilities. What unites all house music is its core mission: to create euphoric, rhythmic experiences that unite dancers in collective movement. The genre's 4/4 heartbeat - kick drum on every beat, typically between 120-130 BPM - remains constant even as production techniques evolve from analog warmth to digital precision. House music's influence extends far beyond dance floors, shaping pop production, R&B rhythms, and electronic music worldwide.

## Characteristics

- **Instrumentation**: Drum machines (Roland TR-808, TR-909), synthesizers (Juno-106, Prophet-5, TB-303 for acid), sampled vocal loops, bass synthesizers, string pads, Rhodes piano samples, atmospheric effects, percussion elements (congas, claps, shakers)
- **Vocals**: Soulful diva vocals (often sampled from disco or gospel), repetitive hooks and vocal chops, whispered or spoken word samples, pitched and time-stretched vocal textures, minimal lyrical content in instrumental subgenres, call-and-response patterns
- **Production**: Four-on-the-floor kick drum pattern (kick on beats 1, 2, 3, 4), open hi-hats on off-beats, tight quantization with occasional humanized swing, layered builds and filtered breakdowns, sidechain compression creating rhythmic "pumping," long intro and outro sections for DJ mixing, emphasis on groove over melody
- **Energy/Mood**: Euphoric and uplifting at its core, ranging from deep introspective warmth to aggressive peak-time intensity; hypnotic and meditative in minimal variations; celebratory and communal; designed for sustained dance floor engagement over hours
- **Structure**: Extended arrangements (6-10 minutes typical), minimal verse-chorus structure, gradual introduction and removal of elements, breakdown sections stripping to drums or atmosphere before rebuilding, repetitive loops with subtle evolution, emphasis on tension-and-release dynamics

## Lyric Conventions

- **Default rhyme scheme**: Minimal — 1–2 bar vocal loops. Groove-driven, not rhyme-driven.
- **Rhyme quality**: Incidental. Short, groovy phrases anchor long mixes.
- **Verse structure**: No traditional verses. Single repeated phrases or very short vocal sections (4–12 words).
- **Key rule**: Groove lock — vocals must serve the rhythm, not compete with it. Uplifting, soulful, or funky tone.
- **Avoid**: Walls of lyrics. Complex rhyme schemes. Anything that breaks the groove.

# House

## Genre Overview

House is an electronic dance music (EDM) genre that originated in Chicago in the early 1980s. Built on a foundation of 4/4 beats, syncopated basslines, and repetitive rhythmic structures, house music emerged from a synthesis of disco, funk, soul, and synthesizer-driven music. The genre is characterized by its relentless groove, infectious energy, and hypnotic quality that makes it ideal for dance floors. House emphasizes accessibility and euphoria, often featuring soulful vocal samples, uplifting melodies, and layers of synthesizers that build emotional momentum throughout tracks. From underground warehouse parties to mainstream festivals, house has become a globally dominant force in electronic music.

## Characteristics

- **Instrumentation**: Drum machines (TR-808, TR-909), synthesizers, sampled vocal loops, bass synthesizers, string pads, atmospheric effects, keyboards
- **Vocals**: Soulful vocal samples, sung choruses, repetitive hooks, often pitched or time-stretched for texture, minimal lyrical content in many subgenres
- **Production**: Four-on-the-floor kick drum, tight quantization, layered effects, gradual building and stripping of elements, sidechain compression, filtered breakdowns
- **Energy/Mood**: High-energy and uplifting, euphoric and transcendent, hypnotic and meditative depending on subgenre, designed for sustained dance floor engagement

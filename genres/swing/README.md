# Swing / Neo-Swing

## Genre Overview

Swing originated in the 1930s-40s big band era and was revived in the 1990s as neo-swing. Characterized by brass sections, walking bass, and infectious rhythms, swing ranges from elegant ballroom to high-energy jump blues. Neo-swing adds punk attitude to the traditional formula.

## Characteristics

- **Instrumentation**: Brass section (trumpet, trombone, sax), upright bass, piano, drums
- **Rhythm**: Swung eighth notes, walking bass, offbeat accents
- **Energy**: Ranges from smooth to frenetic, always danceable
- **Brass**: Tight section playing, punchy accents, "Basie dynamics" (soft-to-loud shifts)
- **Vocals**: Storytelling, swagger, crooner to shouter

# Israel Kamakawiwoʻole (IZ) — Deep Dive

## Overview

Israel Ka'ano'i Kamakawiwoʻole (May 20, 1959 -- June 26, 1997), universally known as IZ or Bruddah IZ, was a Native Hawaiian singer, musician, and sovereignty activist from Honolulu, Hawaii. Standing 6'2" and weighing over 750 pounds at his peak, he was physically imposing yet musically gentle -- a contrast that defined his public persona. His ukulele-and-voice arrangements of Hawaiian traditional songs, original compositions, and reimagined standards made him the most internationally recognized Hawaiian musician in history.

IZ's medley of "Over the Rainbow/What a Wonderful World" -- recorded in a single take at 3 AM in 1988 at Honolulu's Mountain Apple Studios and released on his 1993 album *Facing Future* -- became one of the most-streamed songs of the 20th century, accumulating over one billion YouTube views. The track has been featured in dozens of films, television shows, and commercials, including *50 First Dates*, *Meet Joe Black*, *ER*, *Scrubs*, *Glee*, and countless others. It introduced Hawaiian music to a global audience that had largely never encountered it outside tourist contexts.

Before his solo career, IZ spent two decades as a member of the Makaha Sons of Niʻihau (later the Makaha Sons), one of the most important groups in the Hawaiian Renaissance -- the cultural revival movement that reclaimed Native Hawaiian language, music, hula, and political identity beginning in the 1970s. He was a vocal advocate for Hawaiian sovereignty, using his platform and his music to champion Native Hawaiian rights and self-determination.

IZ died on June 26, 1997, at age 38, from respiratory and cardiac complications related to severe obesity. He was the first (and to date only) non-government official to lie in state at the Hawaii State Capitol building. The state flag was flown at half-staff. Thousands attended his funeral. His ashes were scattered into the Pacific Ocean at Makua Beach on O'ahu's western shore. His music grew even more popular after his death, with posthumous compilations introducing him to successive generations worldwide.

## Background

### Early Life

- **Born:** May 20, 1959, Honolulu, Hawaii
- **Full name:** Israel Ka'ano'i Kamakawiwoʻole (Hawaiian: "the fearless, the brave, the eye of the hawk")
- **Grew up in Kaimukī**, a neighborhood on O'ahu. Later lived in Makaha on the Waianae Coast (west O'ahu), the heartland of Native Hawaiian culture and community.
- **Musical family:** Brother Skippy Kamakawiwoʻole was also a musician and co-founder of the Makaha Sons of Niʻihau. Parents were musical -- exposed early to Hawaiian music and slack-key guitar.
- **Began playing ukulele at age 11.** Largely self-taught. Developed his signature gentle, rhythmic strumming style by absorbing traditional Hawaiian music, reggae, and pop.
- **Physical stature:** IZ was large from childhood and struggled with obesity his entire life. At his peak he weighed over 750 pounds (340 kg). His size became part of his identity -- the "gentle giant" whose physicality contrasted with the sweetness and delicacy of his music. It also caused the health problems that killed him at 38.

### Hawaiian Renaissance Context

IZ emerged during the Hawaiian Renaissance (1960s--1990s), a cultural and political reawakening of Native Hawaiian identity. Key elements:
- Revival of Hawaiian language (ʻōlelo Hawaiʻi), hula, traditional navigation, and music
- Political activism for Hawaiian sovereignty and land rights
- Musicians like Gabby Pahinui, the Sons of Hawaii, and the Sunday Manoa revived traditional Hawaiian slack-key guitar (kī hōʻalu) and falsetto singing
- The Makaha Sons of Niʻihau became central figures in this movement, blending traditional Hawaiian music with contemporary influences

IZ was not merely a musician within this movement -- he became its most visible ambassador, carrying Hawaiian culture to a global audience through the sheer emotional power of his voice and ukulele.

## Career

### Makaha Sons of Niʻihau (1976--1997)

- **Founded 1976** by IZ, his brother Skippy Kamakawiwoʻole, Louis "Moon" Kauakahi, Sam Gray, and Jerome Koko
- **Named after Niʻihau**, the privately owned Hawaiian island known as the "Forbidden Isle" -- symbolizing Native Hawaiian cultural preservation
- **Sound:** Traditional Hawaiian music (mele) blended with contemporary influences -- reggae rhythms, jazz harmonies, pop accessibility. Multi-part vocal harmonies over acoustic guitar, ukulele, and bass.
- **Role in Hawaiian Renaissance:** Among the most important groups reviving and popularizing traditional Hawaiian music for modern audiences. Performed at cultural festivals, political rallies, and concert venues across Hawaii.
- **Skippy's death:** IZ's brother Skippy died in 1982 of a heart attack (also related to obesity). This was a devastating personal loss that deepened IZ's music and his commitment to Hawaiian cultural preservation.
- **Name change:** After lineup changes, the group became simply "the Makaha Sons"
- **Key Makaha Sons albums:**
  - *No Kristo* (1976) -- debut
  - *Kahea O Keale* (1978)
  - *Makaha Sons of Niʻihau* (1984)
  - *Hoʻola* (1986)
  - *Hoʻoluana* (1991)

### Solo Career (1990--1996)

IZ launched his solo career while still performing with the Makaha Sons. His solo work emphasized his ukulele-and-voice arrangements and introduced more pop and reggae elements alongside Hawaiian traditional material.

- **Label:** Milan Records (a subsidiary of BMG, later Universal). Milan typically focused on film soundtracks -- IZ was an unusual signing that proved enormously successful.
- **The 3 AM session:** In 1988, producer Jon de Mello received a phone call from IZ at 3 in the morning asking to record. IZ arrived at Mountain Apple Studios in Honolulu, sat down with his ukulele, and recorded "Over the Rainbow/What a Wonderful World" in a single take. De Mello later described it as one of the most extraordinary moments he had witnessed in a studio.

## Musical Analysis -- What Makes IZ Sound Like IZ

### Ukulele

The ukulele is the foundation of IZ's sound. He played a custom Martin tenor ukulele (some sources say a modified baritone) that looked comically small against his massive frame -- a visual that became iconic. His strumming style was gentle, rhythmic, and steady -- not flashy or technically complex, but perfectly suited to support his voice. The ukulele provided:
- **Warm, rounded chords** in open positions, predominantly major and seventh chords
- **Steady rhythmic pulse** with a gentle reggae-inflected swing
- **Minimal ornamentation** -- IZ let the simplicity of the ukulele speak
- **Hawaiian slack-key influence** in tuning choices and voicings, though adapted to ukulele

The effect was intimate and direct -- one person, one small instrument, one enormous voice. This simplicity is central to IZ's emotional impact. There is nowhere to hide in a ukulele-and-voice arrangement.

### Voice

IZ possessed one of the most recognizable voices in popular music -- a sweet, clear tenor with a surprising lightness and delicacy given his physical size. Key vocal characteristics:
- **Falsetto tradition:** IZ's vocals draw from the Hawaiian falsetto singing tradition (ka leo ki'eki'e), where male singers use a high, sweet head voice. IZ blended chest voice and falsetto seamlessly.
- **Gentle delivery:** Even on uptempo or politically charged material, IZ's vocal approach was warm and inviting rather than aggressive. He communicated urgency through emotion, not volume.
- **Natural vibrato:** Subtle, warm vibrato that added richness without affectation.
- **Hawaiian pronunciation:** Authentic Hawaiian language pronunciation with natural glottal stops (ʻokina) and vowel elongation (kahakō). His Hawaiian-accented English added character and cultural identity to English-language material.
- **Emotional transparency:** IZ's voice conveyed profound emotion -- joy, grief, pride, longing -- with apparent effortlessness. Listeners consistently describe his singing as making them feel simultaneously happy and sad.
- **Range:** Primarily mid-to-high tenor, with falsetto extending further. Not a wide range compared to trained vocalists, but deployed with extraordinary expressiveness.

### Hawaiian Musical Elements

IZ's music is rooted in Hawaiian musical traditions:
- **Mele** (Hawaiian song) -- traditional melodies and lyrical forms
- **Kī hōʻalu** (slack-key guitar) influence -- open tunings, relaxed fingerpicking patterns adapted to ukulele
- **Hawaiian falsetto** (ka leo ki'eki'e) -- high, sweet vocal tradition
- **Hapa haole** music -- the tradition of blending Hawaiian and English lyrics, which IZ continued
- **Chant elements** -- occasional incorporation of oli (Hawaiian chant) phrasing

### Reggae Influence

Reggae has deep roots in Hawaiian popular music -- the two island cultures share musical affinities, and reggae became enormously popular in Hawaii from the 1970s onward (a style sometimes called "Jawaiian"). IZ incorporated:
- **Offbeat rhythmic feel** in ukulele strumming patterns
- **Relaxed, swaying tempo** characteristic of roots reggae
- **Bass emphasis** in full-band arrangements
- **Upbeat, positive lyrical outlook** common to roots reggae

### Production Style

IZ's recordings feature warm, spacious production that foregrounds voice and ukulele:
- **Minimal instrumentation** -- many tracks are essentially solo ukulele and voice
- **Full-band tracks** add acoustic guitar, bass, keyboards, and light percussion without overwhelming the core sound
- **Natural room tone** and warm analog quality
- **Producer Jon de Mello** (Mountain Apple Company) captured IZ's sound with clarity and intimacy
- **No heavy processing** -- IZ's voice needed no studio enhancement

### The Gentle Giant Paradox

The core of IZ's appeal is the contrast between his physical presence (massive, imposing) and his musical presence (gentle, delicate, sweet). This paradox extended to his personality -- by all accounts he was kind, generous, and warm, with a deep laugh and easy manner. His music communicates this same gentleness. It is disarming precisely because it is so unguarded.

## Activism and Cultural Significance

### Hawaiian Sovereignty

IZ was a prominent advocate for Hawaiian sovereignty -- the movement seeking some form of self-governance or independence for Native Hawaiians. His activism manifested through:
- **Music:** Songs like "Hawaiʻi '78" and "E Ala Ē" directly addressed Hawaiian political issues
- **Public advocacy:** Used his celebrity platform to speak on sovereignty, land rights, and cultural preservation
- **Cultural preservation:** His commitment to performing Hawaiian-language music helped keep ʻōlelo Hawaiʻi alive in popular culture
- **Community presence:** Maintained deep ties to the Waianae Coast community and Hawaiian grassroots organizations

### "Hawaiʻi '78"

This track deserves special mention as IZ's most politically significant recording. Written by Mickey Ioane, it imagines Hawaiian royalty -- King Kamehameha and Queen Liliʻuokalani -- looking down at modern Hawaii and weeping at what they see: overdevelopment, military occupation, cultural erosion, the displacement of Native Hawaiians. IZ's performance transforms it from a political statement into an emotional experience -- a lament that transcends politics and speaks to universal themes of cultural loss and longing for home.

### Cultural Legacy

- **First non-government official to lie in state** at the Hawaii State Capitol building (Honolulu)
- **State flag flown at half-staff** -- an honor typically reserved for government officials and military
- **Thousands attended his funeral ceremonies** over several days
- **Ashes scattered at sea** at Makua Beach, O'ahu -- traditional Hawaiian practice
- **Google Doodle** (May 20, 2020) honored what would have been his 61st birthday
- **Annual tributes** continue in Hawaii on the anniversary of his death
- **"Over the Rainbow/What a Wonderful World"** has been used in so many films, TV shows, and commercials that it has become a cultural shorthand for innocence, wonder, and bittersweet beauty

## Death and Legacy

IZ struggled with obesity-related health problems throughout his adult life. He was hospitalized multiple times for respiratory failure and other complications. On June 26, 1997, he died at Queen's Medical Center in Honolulu at age 38. The cause was respiratory failure complicated by cardiac disease, directly related to his severe obesity.

His death prompted an outpouring of grief across Hawaii:
- **Lay in state** at the Hawaii State Capitol -- unprecedented for a non-government figure
- **State flag at half-staff** for the duration of the mourning period
- **Funeral procession** drew thousands along the coast
- **Ashes scattered** at Makua Beach from a traditional Hawaiian outrigger canoe

After his death, IZ's music reached an exponentially larger audience. "Over the Rainbow/What a Wonderful World" was featured in films, TV shows, and commercials throughout the 2000s and 2010s, each placement introducing him to millions of new listeners. The song has accumulated over one billion YouTube views, making IZ one of the most-streamed artists of the 20th century.

*Facing Future* remains the best-selling Hawaiian album of all time. IZ is credited with single-handedly bringing Hawaiian music to global awareness and inspiring a worldwide ukulele revival.

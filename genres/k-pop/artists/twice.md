# TWICE -- Deep Dive

## Overview

TWICE is a nine-member girl group formed by JYP Entertainment through the survival show Sixteen, debuted October 20, 2015. The largest girl group in K-pop by membership, they pioneered "color pop" -- an evolution from bubblegum cute concepts to sophisticated mature pop. With 257+ recorded songs and consistent Korean, Japanese, and English releases, TWICE became the best-selling K-pop girl group of the third generation. Their signature addictive point choreography ("TT" hands, "Cheer Up" shy-shy-shy) defined an era.

## Musical Analysis

### The Color Pop Spectrum
TWICE's signature is bright, saturated pop production -- multiple melodic layers, dense harmonies, and hook-driven structures. Even as they matured, the "colorful" sonic palette persisted, just with deeper hues.

### Nine-Voice Architecture
With nine members, TWICE distributes lines strategically: Jihyo and Nayeon carry power notes, Sana and Momo add texture, rappers Dahyun and Chaeyoung break up melodic sections. The sheer vocal variety creates built-in arrangement complexity.

### Point Choreography as Musical Hook
TWICE songs are engineered around a single repeatable gesture -- the music, choreography, and lyrics lock into one memorable moment. This "point dance" approach influenced an entire generation of K-pop.

### Cute-to-Mature Pipeline
Their discography is a case study in concept evolution: bubble-gum (2015-2017) to teen-confident (2018-2019) to mature pop (2020+), each shift gradual enough to retain fans while gaining new ones.

## Reference Tracks

### 2NE1
- "I Am the Best" (2nd Mini Album, 2011) -- The defining 2NE1 track and a K-pop landmark: military percussion, aggressive synth, CL's iconic rap, and a chorus built entirely on attitude. Pure confidence weaponized as pop music.
- "Fire" (2009) -- Explosive debut single with reggae-dancehall flavor. Announced 2NE1 as the anti-cute revolution in K-pop girl groups.
- "Come Back Home" (Crush, 2014) -- EDM-heavy production with cinematic scope. Two official versions (club and acoustic) demonstrated the group's range.
- "Lonely" (2011) -- Stripped-back emotional ballad. Bom's vocal power and the group's vulnerability proved they were more than just fierce concepts.

### aespa
- "Supernova" (2024) -- Cosmic dance-hyperpop with a pulsing synth riff, four-on-the-floor beat, and euphoric vocal chants. The most commercially successful aespa track and a masterclass in making maximalism radio-friendly.
- "Next Level" (2021) -- The structure-breaking hit that defined aespa's approach. Two songs stitched into one with a dramatic tempo/key transition mid-track. Controversial, iconic, and wildly influential.
- "Savage" (2021) -- Pure hyperpop-glitchcore: stuttering beats, pitch-shifted samples, distorted synths, and a structure in constant motion. The foundational aespa sound.
- "Black Mamba" (2020) -- The debut single. Driving dance-pop with early hints of the glitch aesthetic that would fully develop later. Essential context for the group's sonic evolution.
- "Girls" (2022) -- Rock-influenced beat with electronic flourishes and a more aggressive energy. Shows the group's ability to incorporate organic instrumental textures into their electronic framework.
- "Spicy" (2023) -- Slightly more accessible production with a clearer pop hook, but still dense and layered. The track that proved aespa's sound could scale commercially without compromise.
- "Armageddon" (2024) -- Orchestral drama colliding with industrial electronic production. Features a dramatic beat switch and showcases the full range of the group's maximalist palette.

### ATEEZ
- "Wonderland" (2019) -- The definitive ATEEZ anthem. Orchestral brass fanfares, military percussion, and a chorus that sounds like a cinematic battle charge. Jongho's belt notes soar over the wall of sound.
- "Guerrilla" (2022) -- Rock-influenced rebellion anthem with aggressive energy and driving guitar riffs layered over the signature orchestral-trap framework. The commercial breakthrough track.
- "Bouncy (K-Hot Chilli Peppers)" (2023) -- Brass-heavy Latin funk-hip-hop hybrid with a groove-oriented beat. Demonstrates the group's evolution toward Latin fusion and warmth.
- "Pirate King" (2018) -- The debut single that established the theatrical, pirate-themed identity. Cinematic brass, driving percussion, and dramatic vocal delivery from the first note.

# Lo-Fi

## Genre Overview

Lo-fi music prioritizes atmosphere and mood over technical perfection, embracing the charm of lower-fidelity production as an artistic statement. From jazzy hip-hop beats designed for studying to bedroom pop's intimate songwriting, lo-fi creates a relaxed, accessible soundscape that feels organic and human-scaled. The genre celebrates imperfections—vinyl crackle, tape hiss, ambient noise—as integral parts of the aesthetic rather than flaws to be corrected.

## Characteristics

- **Instrumentation**: Jazz samples, vinyl records, acoustic instruments, electronic elements, ambient textures
- **Production**: Intentionally lo-fidelity, warm, often with vinyl artifacts, tape saturation, ambient noise
- **Vocals**: Often sparse, intimate, or absent; when present, conversational and understated
- **Tempo**: Generally slow to mid-tempo, relaxing and hypnotic
- **Aesthetic**: Chill, nostalgic, study-friendly, introspective; visual branding with anime/retro/cozy imagery

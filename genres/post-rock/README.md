# Post-Rock

## Genre Overview

Post-rock is an experimental genre that uses rock instrumentation—guitar, bass, drums—in unconventional ways to create expansive, cinematic soundscapes. Rather than traditional verse-chorus song structures, post-rock emphasizes gradual builds, orchestral arrangements, and instrumental storytelling. The genre emerged in the 1990s as artists sought to move beyond rock conventions toward more atmospheric, emotionally immersive compositions.

## Characteristics

- **Instrumentation**: Electric guitar, bass, drums, often combined with strings, horns, or other orchestral elements
- **Vocals**: Often absent; when present, typically used as texture rather than focal point
- **Production**: Atmospheric, layered, spacious production with emphasis on dynamics and reverb
- **Energy**: Builds from quiet, delicate passages to crescendos; focuses on dynamics over constant intensity
- **Structure**: Non-traditional; emphasis on instrumental progression, themes, and narrative arc rather than verse-chorus
- **Mood**: Cinematic, melancholic, transcendent, introspective

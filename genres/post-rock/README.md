# Post-Rock

## Genre Overview

Post-rock is an experimental genre that emerged in the early 1990s, using conventional rock instrumentation—guitar, bass, drums—in unconventional ways to create expansive, cinematic soundscapes. The term was coined by critic Simon Reynolds in 1994, though the sonic approach had been developing for years through bands like Talk Talk, Bark Psychosis, and Slint. Rather than adhering to traditional verse-chorus structures, post-rock emphasizes gradual builds, orchestral arrangements, dynamic contrast, and instrumental storytelling that unfolds over extended track lengths.

The genre's origins lie in the convergence of multiple experimental threads: the ambient explorations of Brian Eno, the minimalist repetition of Steve Reich, the textural guitar work of shoegaze bands like My Bloody Valentine, and the angular experimentation of post-punk acts like Joy Division and Wire. Slint's 1991 album *Spiderland* is often cited as a foundational text, its whispered vocals, mathematical dynamics, and jarring crescendos establishing a template that countless bands would expand upon. Tortoise in Chicago and Mogwai in Glasgow independently developed complementary approaches in the mid-1990s, establishing the genre's twin poles of cerebral composition and emotional catharsis.

Post-rock's evolution has taken it from underground art-rock circles to mainstream film and television soundtracks. Explosions in the Sky's work on *Friday Night Lights* and Sigur Rós's widespread soundtrack placements brought the genre's emotional vocabulary to broader audiences. The genre's influence extends far beyond its own boundaries, shaping the production aesthetics of indie rock, ambient electronic music, and film scoring. Contemporary post-rock continues to evolve, incorporating electronic elements, metal heaviness, and neo-classical arrangements while maintaining its core commitment to dynamics, texture, and emotional narrative over lyrical content.

## Characteristics

- **Instrumentation**: Electric guitars (often multiple, heavily effected), bass, drums; frequently augmented with strings, brass, piano, vibraphone, glockenspiel, synthesizers, and field recordings; guitars used for texture and atmosphere rather than traditional riffs
- **Vocals**: Often entirely absent; when present, typically treated as another instrument—buried in the mix, processed beyond recognition, sung in invented languages (Sigur Rós's "Hopelandic"), or delivered as spoken word; lyrics rarely drive meaning
- **Production**: Atmospheric, layered, spacious production emphasizing reverb, delay, and spatial placement; careful attention to dynamics with extreme contrast between quiet and loud passages; often recorded live in rooms to capture natural acoustics
- **Energy/Dynamics**: The genre's signature is the "quiet-loud" dynamic arc: extended quiet, contemplative passages building inexorably toward crushing crescendos; some bands favor sustained tension without release; energy ebbs and flows rather than maintaining consistent intensity
- **Structure**: Non-traditional song structures often spanning 8-15+ minutes; thematic development and variation rather than verse-chorus repetition; many tracks structured as single long arcs; movements within tracks may function like classical suite sections
- **Mood**: Cinematic, melancholic, transcendent, introspective, cathartic, bittersweet; emotional intensity without lyrical specificity allows listeners to project personal meaning; often described as "soundtracks for films that don't exist"
- **Tempo**: Generally moderate to slow (60-100 BPM), though tempos shift dramatically within tracks; half-time feel common during builds; time signature changes and metric modulation add complexity

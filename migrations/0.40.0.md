## Unified Virtual Environment

Prior to 0.40.0, each tool had its own virtual environment:
- `~/.bitwize-music/mastering-env/` — mastering tools
- `~/.bitwize-music/promotion-env/` — promo video tools
- `~/.bitwize-music/cloud-env/` — cloud upload tools

These are now consolidated into a single `~/.bitwize-music/venv/` managed by the setup skill. The old directories can be safely removed.

If auto-cleanup didn't run, use the `cleanup_legacy_venvs` MCP tool or delete manually.

If you haven't run `/bitwize-music:setup` recently, do so to create the unified venv with all dependencies.

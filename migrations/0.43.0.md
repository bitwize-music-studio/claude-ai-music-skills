## MCP Server Expansion

The MCP server was renamed from `state-server` to `bitwize-music-server` to reflect its expanded scope. It now provides 30 tools covering:

- State queries (albums, tracks, skills, ideas, session)
- Path resolution (resolve_path, resolve_track_file)
- Content analysis (check_explicit_content, extract_links, get_lyrics_stats)
- Validation (validate_album_structure, run_pre_generation_gates)
- Album operations (create_album_structure, update_track_field)

The `.mcp.json` file in the plugin root was updated automatically. If you have custom MCP configuration elsewhere, update the server name reference.

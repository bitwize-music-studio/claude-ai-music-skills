## Archiving Found Documents

Always archive court documents:
1. Download PDF directly from PACER/CourtListener
2. Save to album's documents folder
3. Create archive.org backup of source URL
4. Note docket number and access date

**Why**: Court systems change URLs, documents can become inaccessible.

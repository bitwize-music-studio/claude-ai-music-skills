## Prompt Anatomy

**Structure**: `[Subject], [style], [mood/lighting], [color palette], [composition], [technical details], album cover art`

---

## Example 1: Tech Documentary (Distros)

**Concept**: Linux distributions as evolving ecosystem

**Prompt**:
```
Abstract digital tree made of circuit board traces, roots formed from command line code,
branches creating tux penguin silhouette, vibrant gradient from green terminal glow to
orange Ubuntu to red hat, dark background fading to black, isometric view, technical
illustration style, clean and modern, high detail, 4k, album cover art
```

**Why it works**:
- Specific subject (circuit tree, penguin)
- Clear style (technical illustration)
- Defined colors (green, orange, red)
- Composition detail (isometric, dark background)

---

## Example 2: True Crime (Corporate Scandal)

**Concept**: Corporate corruption, hidden darkness

**Prompt**:
```
Corporate boardroom from dramatic low angle, empty leather chairs around polished table,
single overhead light creating harsh shadows, document with redacted text in foreground,
film noir style, high contrast black and white with single red accent, cinematic lighting,
photorealistic, moody and ominous, 4k resolution, album cover art
```

**Why it works**:
- Specific scene (boardroom, chairs, document)
- Clear mood (noir, ominous)
- Defined lighting (overhead, harsh shadows)
- Color strategy (B&W with red accent)

## Example 3: Electronic/Ambient

**Concept**: Digital consciousness, abstract data

and dispersing, deep blue and cyan color palette with electric purple accents, dark
void background, motion blur effect, digital art style, ethereal and mysterious,
centered composition, 3d render, high resolution, album cover art
```

**Why it works**:

at golden hour, wheat field stretching to horizon, soft focus background, warm amber

## Example 6: Concept Album (Surrender)

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Too Busy
**Problem**: Too many elements, cluttered composition
**Fix**: Focus on one strong element, use negative space

### 2. Cliché
**Problem**: Generic genre imagery (mic for hip-hop, guitar for rock)
**Fix**: Find unique angle on familiar symbols, use metaphor

### 3. Doesn't Scale
**Problem**: Looks great full-size, illegible at thumbnail
**Fix**: Test at small size early, simplify if needed

### 4. Wrong Mood
**Problem**: Serious album has cheerful art (or vice versa)
**Fix**: Align visual mood with musical mood via color, lighting, style

### 5. Too Literal
**Problem**: Album about cars shows car (boring)
**Fix**: Symbolic representation, unusual angle, artistic interpretation

### 6. Text Overload
**Problem**: Album title, artist name, tracklist, year all on cover
**Fix**: Minimal text, let image speak, text can be added digitally later

### Thumbnail Test

**Critical**: Art must work at 200x200px or smaller

**Test**:

3. Does it stand out in a grid?
4. Is text readable (if any)?

**If no**: Simplify. Reduce detail. Increase contrast.

## AI Art Platforms

*Note: AI art platforms evolve rapidly. These are examples - capabilities and recommendations may change.*

**Midjourney** (Discord-based):
- Best for artistic, stylized results
- Strong with composition and mood
- Prompt format: `/imagine [prompt] --ar 1:1 --v 6`

**DALL-E** (ChatGPT/API):
- Good for photorealistic and literal interpretations
- Easier for beginners
- Handles text better than some alternatives

**Stable Diffusion** (Local/Web):
- Most control and customization
- Steeper learning curve
- Free and open source

**General Recommendation**: Look for platforms that produce consistent, professional-quality results with strong composition sense.

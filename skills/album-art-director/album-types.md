# Album Types & Visual Approaches

Visual strategies for different album categories.

---

## Documentary / True Crime Albums

**Visual strategy**: Authenticity and gravity

**Approaches**:

1. **Archival/Documentary Style**
   - Vintage photograph aesthetic
   - Newspaper clippings, evidence photos
   - Redacted documents, court files
   - Black and white or desaturated color

2. **Symbolic Representation**
   - Objects related to story (handcuffs, scales, computer)
   - Location photography (courtroom, headquarters, crime scene)
   - Abstract representation of key moment

3. **Portrait-Based**
   - Stylized portrait of key figure
   - Silhouette or partial face
   - Avoid literal photos (rights issues)

**Example - Dark Tide Album** (historical disaster documentary):
```
Concept: Industrial negligence looming over immigrant neighborhood
Visual: Massive rusted tank towering over cramped tenements,
        dark sepia and brown tones, 1919 Boston atmosphere,
        ominous calm before the disaster
Style: Vintage photograph meets punk rock, gritty, high contrast
```

## Concept Albums (Non-Narrative)

**Visual strategy**: Mood and metaphor

**Approaches**:

1. **Abstract/Atmospheric**
   - Color fields, textures
   - Evoke emotion without literal subject
   - Minimal or no recognizable objects

2. **Symbolic/Metaphorical**
   - Central symbol representing theme
   - Surreal combinations
   - Visual poetry

3. **Typographic**
   - Album title as primary visual
   - Custom lettering
   - Type as image

**Example - Surrender Album**:
```
Concept: Letting go, release
Visual: Open hands releasing glowing particles into sky, soft sunset colors,
        particles dissolving into light, peaceful but dynamic, close-up on hands,
        background bokeh blur
Style: Cinematic photography, warm tones, gentle movement
```

## Character Study Albums

**Visual strategy**: Identity and presence

2. **Symbolic Objects**
   - Items associated with person
   - Environmental portrait (workspace, location)

   - Avoid rights issues

## Storytelling / Narrative Albums

## Collection Albums

## Handling Problematic Content

### Avoiding Copyright Issues

**Don't use**:
- Real people's faces (unless public domain or licensed)
- Copyrighted logos or brands (unless essential and fair use)
- Trademarked characters or symbols
- Other artists' work as reference

**Safe alternatives**:
- Stylized interpretations, not literal copies
- Silhouettes instead of faces
- Generic objects instead of branded items
- Original symbolic representations

### Sensitive Subject Matter

**For true crime/dark topics**:
- Avoid glorifying violence
- Symbolic > literal depiction
- Tasteful and respectful
- Consider victim families

**For historical events**:
- Research visual sensitivities
- Avoid offensive stereotypes
- Respectful representation

# Album Types Reference

Detailed planning approaches for each album category.

---

## 1. True Crime / Documentary

**Definition**: Real events, real people, factual storytelling

**Planning Questions**:
- What's the central event/story?
- Who are the key players?
- What's the timeline?
- What sources exist? (Court docs, news, press releases)
- What's the angle? (Not just "what happened" but "why does it matter")
- How many tracks needed to tell story completely?

**Structure Approaches**:
- **Chronological**: Track 1 = beginning, final track = resolution
- **Thematic**: Group by themes, not timeline
- **Character-focused**: Each track follows a different person
- **Event-focused**: Each track = a critical moment

**Example**: Album about the Great Molasses Flood (Dark Tide)
- Tracks 1-4: The Monster (the neighborhood, the tank, warnings ignored)
- Tracks 5-8: The Wave (the disaster, chaos, death, heroism)
- Tracks 9-11: The Reckoning (the lies, the trial, the verdict)

## 2. Storytelling / Narrative

**Definition**: Fictional or dramatized story told across tracks

**Planning Questions**:
- Who is the protagonist?
- What do they want?
- What's preventing them from getting it?
- How does it resolve?
- What's the emotional arc?

**Structure Approaches**:
- **Three-act**: Setup (tracks 1-3), Conflict (4-8), Resolution (9-12)
- **Character journey**: Each track = stage of character development
- **Multiple perspectives**: Different characters tell same story
- **Non-linear**: Fragments that connect by end

**Example**: Concept album about addiction recovery
- Tracks 1-3: Descent (hitting bottom)
- Tracks 4-6: Recognition (realizing need for change)
- Tracks 7-9: Struggle (recovery process)
- Tracks 10-12: Emergence (new life, looking back)

## 3. Thematic Concept

**Definition**: United by theme, mood, or idea (not plot)

**Planning Questions**:
- What's the central theme?
- What are the sub-themes or facets?
- What emotions should each track evoke?
- How do tracks connect without being narrative?
- What's the sonic throughline?

**Structure Approaches**:
- **Exploration**: Each track examines theme from different angle
- **Emotional arc**: Journey through related feelings
- **Contrasts**: Light/dark, hope/despair, past/future
- **Mosaic**: Pieces that form larger picture

**Example**: Album about "Surrender"
- Tracks explore different meanings: giving up, letting go, acceptance, trust, defeat, peace
- Not a story, but emotional progression from resistance to release

---

## 4. Character Study

**Definition**: Deep dive into a person (real or fictional)

**Planning Questions**:
- Who is this person?
- What aspects of them will you explore?
- What time period(s)?
- What's the through-line?
- What makes them compelling?

**Structure Approaches**:
- **Life stages**: Childhood → youth → adulthood → legacy
- **Facets**: Different roles (father, CEO, addict, visionary)
- **Defining moments**: Tracks = pivotal events in their life
- **Internal/external**: Alternate between inner thoughts and outer actions

**Example**: Album about Edward Snowden
- Tracks explore: childhood, NSA career, discovery of surveillance, decision to leak, Hong Kong escape, exile, legacy

---

## 5. Collection

**Definition**: Standalone songs with loose connection

**Planning Questions**:
- What's the unifying element? (Even if loose)
- Genre consistency or variety?
- Is there an intentional flow, or is variety the point?
- Any narrative throughline, or purely thematic?

**Structure Approaches**:
- **Best foot forward**: Strongest track first
- **Energy arc**: High → low → high, or gradual build
- **Palette cleanser**: Vary styles to prevent fatigue
- **Bookends**: Strong opener and closer, looser middle

**Example**: Collection of Linux distro songs
- Unified by subject (Linux), each track standalone
- Arranged chronologically by distro release date
- Creates accidental narrative of Linux history

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Too Much Setup
**Problem**: Tracks 1-3 all "introduction," real story doesn't start until track 4
**Fix**: Start in the middle, fill in backstory as needed

### 2. Flat Arc
**Problem**: Every track same energy, no dynamics
**Fix**: Intentional peaks and valleys

### 3. No Payoff
**Problem**: Build build build... then ends abruptly
**Fix**: Closing track must deliver emotional resolution

### 4. Burying the Hit
**Problem**: Best track is hidden at track 9
**Fix**: Front-load quality, especially tracks 1 and 3

### 5. Concept Overwhelms Music
**Problem**: Clever concept, but songs aren't compelling
**Fix**: Concept serves music, not vice versa

### 6. Too Much Explanation
**Problem**: Liner notes required to understand album
**Fix**: Music should stand on its own

## Length & Format

### EP (4-6 tracks)
**Best for**:
- Testing new direction
- Single concept explored deeply
- Introduction to new artist
- Tightly focused themes

**Structure**: Intro → Development → Climax → Resolution

### Standard Album (8-12 tracks)
**Best for**:
- Complete statements
- Narrative albums
- Established artist projects
- Traditional distribution

**Structure**: Three-act or thematic sections

### Double Album (15+ tracks)
**Best for**:
- Epic stories requiring space
- Comprehensive documentaries
- Sprawling concepts
- Career-defining statements

**Structure**: Movements, sections, or discs with distinct identities

**Challenge**: Maintaining listener attention - must justify length

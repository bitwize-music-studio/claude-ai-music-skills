## Verification Techniques

### Confirming Identity

**Strong verification**:
- Verified account badge
- Linked from official website
- Consistent posting history
- Self-identification elsewhere

**Medium verification**:
- Writing style matches
- Technical knowledge consistent
- Cross-referenced in journalism
- Account age/history

**Weak verification**:
- Just matches name
- New account
- No verification markers
- Contradicts known facts

### Detecting Impersonation
Watch for:
- Recent account creation
- No history of activity
- Claims that contradict known facts
- Overly dramatic statements
- Requests for money/info

### Authenticating Leaked Content
If using leaked materials:
1. Has journalism verified authenticity?
2. Does content match known facts?
3. Is writing style consistent?
4. Any denials of authenticity?
5. What's the source of the leak?

## Deleted Content Recovery

### Archive Services
- **Wayback Machine**: First stop for most content
- **Archive.today**: Often captures what Wayback misses
- **Google Cache**: Recent deletions (temporary)
- **Bing Cache**: Sometimes available

### Social Media Specific
- **Politwoops**: Deleted politician tweets
- **Screenshots in journalism**: Often captured
- **Thread readers**: May preserve deleted threads

### When Content Is Gone
1. Check all archive services
2. Search for screenshots in news coverage
3. Look for quotes in articles
4. Check if content was reposted elsewhere
5. Document that original is unavailable

---

## Context and Tone

### Understanding Context
For any quote, document:
- What prompted this statement?
- Who was the audience?
- What was happening at the time?
- Was this serious or joking?
- Any follow-up or clarification?

### Tone Indicators
- Platform (formal LinkedIn vs. casual Twitter)
- Thread context (responding to criticism?)
- Time of day (late night vs. business hours)
- Historical moment (during crisis?)

---

## Ethical Guidelines

### Public vs. Private Content

**Clearly public**:
- Public tweets/posts
- Published blog posts
- Public forum posts
- Conference talks

**Gray area**:
- Deleted posts (archived)
- Semi-private forums
- Old posts (context changed)

**Private**:
- DMs/private messages
- Closed group discussions
- Personal correspondence

### Using Deleted Content
Consider:
- Why was it deleted?
- Is the subject a public figure?
- Does public interest justify use?
- Could this cause harm?

## For Lyrics

### Capturing Voice
Why primary sources matter:
- Journalist: "He said the project was important"
- Primary: "This is my life's work. I'll maintain it until I die."

### What to Extract
- Word choice and verbal tics
- Emotional moments
- Self-presentation
- Contradictions
- Memorable phrases

### Attribution in Lyrics
```
Direct (documented):
"He posted at 3 AM, 'I can't do this anymore'"

Narrator voice (based on sources):
"At 3 AM, he typed out his goodbye"
```

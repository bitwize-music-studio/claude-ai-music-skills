| Polished | Radio-ready, compressed, loud |
| Atmospheric | Spacious, reverb, ambient |

### Era/Vintage

- "80s production" - gated reverb, synths, big drums
- "90s grunge" - raw, mid-heavy, distorted
- "Modern pop" - compressed, bright, wide stereo
- "Vintage soul" - warm, analog, tape saturation

### Dynamic Range

- "Dynamic range" - loud/soft variation (ballads, emotional arcs)

## Artist Name Warning

**NEVER use real artist names in Suno style prompts** - Suno blocks them.

Instead, describe the artist's style:

| Don't Write | Write Instead |
|-------------|---------------|
| "NIN style" | "dark industrial, grinding synths, distorted vocals" |
| "Carly Rae Jepsen" | "upbeat synth-pop, 80s-influenced, breathy female vocals" |
| "Ministry influence" | "aggressive industrial rock, rapid-fire percussion, distorted" |
| "Johnny Cash" | "deep baritone, traditional country, train-beat rhythm" |

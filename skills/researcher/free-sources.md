# Free Document Sources

This reference lists free sources for court documents and legal materials.

## Key Principle

U.S. federal court documents have **no copyright** (17 U.S.C. § 105). PACER charges for *access convenience*, not ownership. These documents are often freely available from third-party archives.

**ALWAYS exhaust free sources before considering PACER.**

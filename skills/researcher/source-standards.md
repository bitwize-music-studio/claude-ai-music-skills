## Source Tier Hierarchy

### Tier 1: Primary Sources (REQUIRED for all key facts)

**Court Documents** - READ THESE IN FULL:
- Indictments (every page, every count)
- Trial transcripts (relevant witness testimony)
- Sentencing memoranda (government and defense versions)
- Verdicts (jury instructions, verdict forms)
- Appeals filings (arguments on both sides)

**Government Documents** - FULL TEXT REQUIRED:
- SEC complaints (read all paragraphs, not just press release)
- DOJ press releases (use as INDEX, then find source docs)
- Agency reports (CMS, FDA - complete inspection findings)
- Congressional testimony (full transcripts, not excerpts)

**Corporate Documents** - WHEN AVAILABLE:
- SEC filings (10-K, 8-K, proxy statements)
- Earnings call transcripts
- Press releases (archived originals)
- Financial statements

**Direct Sources**:
- Speeches (full video/transcript, not clips)
- Interviews (complete interview, not edited quotes)
- Social media (original posts with timestamps)

---

### Tier 2: Investigative Journalism (Verify Against Primary)

**Acceptable IF**:
- Reporter has track record (Pulitzer, major awards)
- Article cites primary sources extensively
- Original reporting (not aggregation)
- Long-form investigative piece (3000+ words)

**Still require**:
- Verify key facts against the primary sources cited
- Don't trust journalist's interpretation blindly
- Check if corrections/updates issued

**Examples**:
- John Carreyrou's WSJ investigation ✅
- ProPublica deep dives ✅
- Generic news aggregation ❌

---

### Tier 3: Expert Analysis (Supporting Context Only)

**Use for**:
- Legal analysis of court decisions
- Technical explanations
- Industry context
- Comparison to similar cases

**Do NOT use for**:
- Establishing facts (must come from Tier 1-2)
- Direct quotes without verification
- Opinion presented as fact

---

### Tier 4: Background (Overview Only)

**Wikipedia, encyclopedias**:
- Use as starting point ONLY
- Extract timeline and key player list
- Identify primary sources to pursue
- NEVER cite Wikipedia as source for key facts

---

## Key Facts That Require Triple-Verification

- Dates, times, locations
- Financial figures (exact amounts, valuations, losses)
- Legal outcomes (charges, convictions, sentences)
- Direct quotes from real people
- Chronological sequences of events

## What NOT To Do

| Wrong | Right |
|-------|-------|
| "According to court documents..." (citing news) | "Indictment p.47 states..." (citing actual doc) |
| Single source for key fact | 3+ independent sources |
| "The trial revealed..." (vague) | "Transcript Day 5, p.234, Smith testified..." |
| Trust journalist interpretation | Verify against primary sources cited |
| Wikipedia as fact source | Wikipedia as starting point only |

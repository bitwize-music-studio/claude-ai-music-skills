# Documentary & True Crime Legal Standards

Legal guidelines for writing lyrics about real people and events.

---

## When to Apply These Standards

Apply documentary legal standards for:
- **True crime albums** (criminal cases, trials, investigations)
- **Documentary storytelling** (real events, real people)
- **Biographical work** (artist profiles of real people)
- **Historical narratives** (factual events from history)
- **Any work citing sources** (if RESEARCH.md or SOURCES.md exists)

---

## Core Legal Principles

**The Five Rules:**
1. **No impersonation** - Use third-person narrator voice only, never speak AS the person
2. **No fabricated quotes** - Never put words in quotes unless documented in sources
3. **No internal state claims** - Never claim to know what someone thought, felt, believed, or feared
4. **No speculative actions** - Stick to documented events, don't invent daily activities
5. **No negative factual claims** - Don't claim "nobody saw" or "nobody heard" (can't prove negatives)

## What to AVOID (High Risk)

### Internal State Claims
- ❌ "She was afraid"
- ❌ "He felt angry"
- ❌ "She believed him"
- ❌ "He knew it was wrong"
- ❌ "She wanted to escape"
- ❌ "Living in fear"
- ❌ "Tried to disappear"
- ❌ "Can't believe what's real"
- ❌ "Didn't know where to go"

### Fabricated Quotes
- ❌ "I need help," she cried
- ❌ "We'll start the process," they said
- ❌ Direct speech without documented source

### Speculative Actions
- ❌ "She finally made the call" (unless documented HOW)
- ❌ "Goes to sleep that night" (undocumented private action)
- ❌ "Waiting for the call" (speculative daily activity)
- ❌ "June 21st she waited" (inventing specific undocumented timeline)

### Negative Factual Claims
- ❌ "Nobody heard her scream"
- ❌ "Nobody saw what happened"
- ❌ "No one knew the truth"

---

## What to USE Instead (Legally Safe)

### Pattern-Based Language
- ✅ "The pattern started" (not "first time")
- ✅ "The cycle repeated" (not "second time")
- ✅ "Years of documented abuse" (pattern, not specific incidents)

### Observable Behavior
- ✅ "She called 911" (documented action)
- ✅ "Court records show" (attributed to source)
- ✅ "Testimony revealed" (documented in trial)
- ✅ "The walls kept her screams in" (describes situation, not claiming "nobody heard")

### Documented Psychiatric/Medical States
- ✅ "Brief reactive psychosis" (diagnosis from doctor)
- ✅ "PTSD confirmed" (documented diagnosis)
- ✅ "Testimony says she lost her mind" (attributed to testimony)

### Narrator Description vs. Internal Claims
- ✅ "She asked for protection" (observable, documented)
- ❌ "She felt desperate" (internal state)
- ✅ "Reality hitting hard" (narrator observation of situation)
- ❌ "She couldn't process" (internal mental state)
- ✅ "Four years of violence" (documented pattern)
- ❌ "Four years of hiding" (internal intention)

### Timing Without Speculation
- ✅ "Two days before June 23rd" (documented timing)
- ❌ "June 21st she waited, June 22nd still nothing" (speculative daily actions)

---

## Attribution Techniques

When you need to describe something close to internal state, **attribute it to a source:**

- ✅ "Doctors diagnosed PTSD"
- ✅ "Testimony revealed years of abuse"
- ✅ "Court records documented the pattern"
- ✅ "She testified 'You hurt me again and again'" (actual quote with attribution)
- ✅ "According to trial testimony" (explicit attribution)

---

## Before/After Examples

### Example 1: Internal State
- ❌ BEFORE: "She was living in dread, trying to survive"
- ✅ AFTER: "Years of documented abuse, the pattern escalating"

### Example 2: Fabricated Quote
- ❌ BEFORE: "'I need protection,' she begged"
- ✅ AFTER: "She asked for protection, asked to get away"

### Example 3: Speculative Action
- ❌ BEFORE: "She finally made the call, hiding in the bathroom"
- ✅ AFTER: "She reached out for help, contacted the authorities"

### Example 4: Negative Claim
- ❌ BEFORE: "Nobody heard her scream, nobody saw"
- ✅ AFTER: "The walls kept her screams in, the world couldn't see within"

### Example 5: Pattern vs. Specific
- ❌ BEFORE: "The first time he hit her, the second time worse"
- ✅ AFTER: "The pattern started, the cycle repeated, years of escalation"

## The Documentary Standard

**Ask yourself for EVERY line:**
1. Can I cite this claim to a specific source?
2. Am I claiming internal knowledge I can't have?
3. Am I inventing quotes or dialogue?
4. Am I speculating about undocumented actions?
5. Am I making negative claims I can't prove?

**If the answer to ANY of these is problematic, rewrite the line.**

## Why This Matters

Legal issues can:
- Expose you to defamation claims
- Undermine the credibility of the entire work
- Require expensive revisions or takedowns
- Damage your reputation as a documentary artist

**The standard**: If you can't cite it, don't write it. If you can't prove it, don't claim it. If it's internal, don't assume it.

# Lyric Writer Examples

Before/after transformations demonstrating key lyric writing principles.

## Show Don't Tell

### Example 1: Heartbreak

**Weak (tells the emotion):**
```
I was devastated when she left
My heart was broken, feeling bereft
I couldn't believe that she was gone
I felt so empty and alone
```

**Strong (shows through action and imagery):**
```
Found her coffee mug still in the sink
Poured it out but couldn't watch it drain
Her keys still hanging by the door
I keep forgetting she's not coming back
```

**Why it works**: The strong version uses concrete objects (mug, keys, door) and actions (poured, hanging, forgetting) that let listeners feel the emotion without being told what to feel.

---

### Example 2: Anger

**Weak:**
```
I'm so angry at what you did
You made me furious, I must admit
```

**Strong:**
```
Threw your picture at the wall
Glass still scattered in the hall
```

**Why it works**: Physical action (threw, scattered) conveys anger more powerfully than stating it.

---

## Prosody (Syllable Stress)

Stressed syllables must land on strong beats (1 and 3 in 4/4 time).

### Example 1: Multi-syllable Word

**Bad prosody (emphasis on wrong syllable):**
```
I need to find my des-TIN-y
```
Sung naturally, "destiny" stresses DES-ti-ny, not des-TIN-y.

**Fixed:**
```
I need to find my DES-ti-ny
```
Or restructure:
```
My DES-ti-ny is CALL-ing me
```

**Why it works**: Natural speech stress aligns with musical downbeats.

---

### Example 2: Preposition Emphasis

**Bad prosody:**
```
I walked IN-to THE room
```
Prepositions and articles shouldn't land on strong beats.

**Fixed:**
```
I WALKED in-to the ROOM
```

**Why it works**: Content words (walked, room) take emphasis, not function words (into, the).

---

## Twin Verses (V2 Must Develop)

V2 should advance the story, deepen emotion, or shift perspective — not rephrase V1.

### Example 1: Narrative Song

**Bad (V2 twins V1):**
```
[Verse 1]
The streets are cold, I walk alone
No one around, just skin and bone

[Verse 2]
The roads are freezing, by myself
Empty sidewalks, no one else
```
V2 restates V1 with synonyms: streets→roads, cold→freezing, alone→by myself.

**Fixed (V2 develops):**
```
[Verse 1]
The streets are cold, I walk alone
No one around, just skin and bone

[Verse 2]
Found your old coat in the closet
Still smells like smoke and home
```

**Why it works**: V2 introduces new detail (the coat), shifts emotional register (nostalgia), and advances the internal story.

---

### Example 2: Character Song

**Bad (V2 twins V1):**
```
[Verse 1]
He built an empire from the ground
The biggest name in every town

[Verse 2]
He made a fortune, rose so high
The greatest man beneath the sky
```

**Fixed (V2 complicates):**
```
[Verse 1]
He built an empire from the ground
The biggest name in every town

[Verse 2]
But late at night the ledgers showed
The debt behind the golden throne
```

**Why it works**: V2 introduces conflict and reveals what V1's success was hiding.

---

## Verse-Chorus Echo

The verse should set up the chorus, not preview it.

### Example 1: Shared Hook Word

**Bad:**
```
[Verse]
We started something that will never end
This is where it all got its START

[Chorus]
Where it all got its START
Where we found our heart
```
"Start" appears in both — chorus loses impact.

**Fixed:**
```
[Verse]
We started something that will never end
This is where we lit the spark

[Chorus]
Where it all got its start
Where we found our heart
```

**Why it works**: "Spark" sets up "start" without stealing it. The chorus still lands fresh.

---

### Example 2: Shared Imagery

**Bad:**
```
[Verse]
Standing in the warehouse, dust in the air
Machines gone quiet, no one left to care

[Chorus]
This warehouse holds our memories
These walls remember everything
```
"Warehouse" and "walls" appear in both.

**Fixed:**
```
[Verse]
Footsteps echo where the machines once ran
Dust on every surface, silence where we began

[Chorus]
This warehouse holds our memories
These walls remember everything
```

**Why it works**: Verse describes the space without naming it; chorus reveals the location.

---

## Filler Phrases

Lines padded to hit a rhyme or syllable count.

### Example 1: Quote Setup Padding

**Bad:**
```
And then he turned around and said to me
These words that I will not forget, you see
"The truth will set you free"
```
"These words that I will not forget, you see" is filler padding to the quote.

**Fixed:**
```
He turned and locked eyes with me
"The truth will set you free"
```

**Why it works**: Direct setup, no padding. Every word earns its place.

---

### Example 2: Syllable Padding

**Bad:**
```
I really truly deeply feel the pain
Of losing you, it drives me quite insane
```
"Really truly deeply" and "quite" are filler.

**Fixed:**
```
I feel the weight of losing you
It's driving me insane
```

**Why it works**: Fewer words, same meaning, stronger impact.

---

## Forced Rhymes

Never bend grammar or use unnatural phrasing just to land a rhyme.

### Example 1: Inverted Word Order

**Bad:**
```
Into the night so dark I walked
Of all the things we never talked
```
"Of all the things we never talked" inverts natural order for rhyme.

**Fixed:**
```
I walked into the darkest night
We never talked — that wasn't right
```

**Why it works**: Natural word order, rhyme still works. Or use a near-rhyme:

```
Into the night so dark I walked
Thinking of words we'd never said
```

---

### Example 2: Forced Synonym

**Bad:**
```
She left me standing in the rain
My heart was filled with so much bane
```
"Bane" is archaic and forced.

**Fixed:**
```
She left me standing in the rain
I don't think I'll be whole again
```

**Why it works**: Natural language, emotional truth over perfect rhyme.

---

## Too Vague vs. Too Specific

### Example 1: Too Vague

**Bad:**
```
Everything changed that day
Nothing would be the same
We all felt different after
Things were never like before
```
No concrete details — could describe anything.

**Fixed:**
```
The phone lit up at 2 AM
Your voice cracked on the line
I sat down on the kitchen floor
The dog just licked my hand
```

**Why it works**: Specific details (2 AM, kitchen floor, dog) ground the universal experience of receiving bad news without stating "I got bad news."

---

### Example 2: Too Specific (Alienating)

**Bad:**
```
Remember when we saw Jen's cousin Mark
At the Walgreens on North Dearborn and Clark
He said his friend from Accounting Two
Got fired by Linda from the Wednesday crew
```
Too many proper nouns that mean nothing to listeners.

**Fixed:**
```
Remember running into him
At the drugstore, late that night
He said he heard the news at work
Someone finally saw the light
```

**Why it works**: Specific enough to feel real, universal enough to resonate.

---

## Rhyme Quality

### Example 1: Self-Rhyme

**Bad:**
```
I gave you all my love
You threw away my love
```
"Love" rhymes with itself.

**Fixed:**
```
I gave you all my heart
You tore that love apart
```

---

### Example 2: Predictable Rhyme

**Bad:**
```
You set my heart on fire
Burning with desire
```
Fire/desire is overused to the point of cliche.

**Fixed:**
```
You set my heart on fire
Now I'm just ash and bone
```

**Why it works**: Unexpected image (ash and bone) instead of predictable rhyme partner.

---

## Density Mismatch

Match lyric density to tempo and mood.

### Example: Laid-Back Track with Dense Lyrics

**Musical Direction says**: "Slow groove, 75 BPM, laid-back feel"

**Bad (too dense for tempo):**
```
[Verse]
Running through the city streets at night, sirens blaring
Cops on every corner, helicopter in the air
Ducking through the alley, jumping fences, heart is pounding
Gotta make it to the bridge before they catch me there
Breathless at the river, looking back at what I'm leaving
Everything I knew is burning, there's no turning back
```
Six packed lines at 75 BPM — Suno will rush or compress.

**Fixed (matches tempo):**
```
[Verse]
Slow night in the city
Streetlights on the rain
Nothing but the echo
Of an empty train
```

**Why it works**: Four short lines give the slow tempo room to breathe.

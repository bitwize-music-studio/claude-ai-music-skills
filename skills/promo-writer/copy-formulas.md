## Hook Formulas

Every post needs a hook — the first line that stops the scroll. Pick the formula that fits the content.

### 1. Question Hook
Pose a question the album or track answers.

```
What happens when [premise]?
Ever wonder what [subject] sounds like as [genre]?
What if [concept] had a soundtrack?
```

**Best for**: Concept albums, story-driven tracks, thought-provoking themes
**Platforms**: Twitter (punchy questions), Instagram (caption openers), Facebook (comment bait)

### 2. Story Hook
Open with a narrative fragment that demands the rest.

```
It started with [inciting incident].
In [year], [subject] did something no one expected.
This track is about the moment when [turning point].
```

**Best for**: True-story/documentary albums, personal tracks, tracks with strong narratives
**Platforms**: Twitter threads, Instagram long captions, Facebook, YouTube descriptions

### 3. Contrast Hook
Juxtapose two unexpected elements.

```
[Genre A] meets [Genre B]. [Result].
The story of [dark topic] — told through [unexpected genre].
[Beautiful thing] built on [ugly truth].
```

**Best for**: Genre-blending albums, unexpected sonic choices, dark/light thematic contrast
**Platforms**: Twitter (concise contrast), TikTok (visual + audio contrast)

### 4. Number Hook
Lead with a specific, concrete detail.

```
[Number] tracks. [Number] true stories. One album.
[Number] months of research. [Number] sources. Every lyric verified.
[Number] tracks about [topic] you've never heard before.
```

**Best for**: Album announcements, documentary albums (emphasize research depth), tracklist reveals
**Platforms**: Twitter, Instagram carousels, TikTok text overlays

### 5. Quote Hook
Lead with the most quotable lyric or line from the track.

```
"[Quotable lyric]"

Track [N] from [album] — streaming now.
```

**Best for**: Tracks with strong individual lines, ongoing promotion, lyric-driven content
**Platforms**: Twitter (standalone quotes), Instagram (lyric graphics), TikTok (text overlay on audio)

### 6. Behind-the-Scenes Hook
Reveal something about the creative process.

```
This track almost didn't make the album. Here's why it did.
The hardest lyric to write on this album was [track] — here's the story.
I rewrote [track] [number] times before it felt right.
```

**Best for**: Post-release content, building artist authenticity, process-focused audiences
**Platforms**: Twitter threads, TikTok (talking to camera), Instagram Stories

## Engagement Post Ideas Beyond Announcements

Don't only post when you have something to sell. Between releases:

1. **"What I'm listening to"** — share other artists' music you enjoy
2. **"Making of" process shots** — DAW screenshots, lyric drafts, revision comparisons
3. **Polls** — "What genre should I try next?" or "Album art A or B?"
4. **Throwback** — revisit an older track with new context
5. **Fan interaction** — reshare someone who posted about your music
6. **Hot take** — opinion on music, genre, production (authentic, not inflammatory)
7. **Milestone celebration** — "500 streams!" (small wins are relatable)
8. **Question of the day** — "What song changed your life?"
9. **Lyric card** — one quotable line from a track, designed as a graphic
10. **"Did you know?"** — fact from your research (documentary albums)

## Tone Adaptation Guide

The same core message, adapted for each platform:

### Example: Album release announcement

**Core message**: New album "[Album Name]" is out — it's about [concept].

**Twitter** (punchy, direct):
```
[Album Name] is out now.

[Concept in one sentence].

[Number] tracks. Stream everywhere: [link]

#NewMusic #Genre
```

**Instagram** (visual + story):
```
[Album Name] is here.

[2-3 sentences about the story behind it — personal angle]

[CTA: "Link in bio. Which track hits hardest?"]

.
.
.
[Hashtag block]
```

**TikTok** (casual, authentic):
```
new album just dropped. [concept in casual language]
#NewMusic #Genre
```
(Video does the work — show your face, play a snippet)

**Facebook** (storytelling):
```
[Personal story about why you made this album — 3-5 paragraphs]

[Track highlights]

[CTA: "What do you think? I'd love to hear your take."]

[Link]
```

**YouTube** (informative):
```
[Album Name] - [Artist] (Full Album)

[Concept summary] | Stream everywhere: [link]

[Full credits, track listing, social links below]
```

The key: same message, native format. Never cross-post identical text.

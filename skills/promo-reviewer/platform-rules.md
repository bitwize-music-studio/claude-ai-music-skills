## Twitter/X Rules

### Character Counting
- **Hard limit**: 280 characters per tweet
- URLs count as 23 characters (t.co shortening)
- Emojis count as 2 characters
- Hashtags count toward the 280 limit
- Mentions (@name) count toward the 280 limit

### Thread Rules
- Each tweet in a thread must be standalone under 280 chars
- First tweet should hook — it's what people see in timeline
- Number tweets for clarity (1/, 2/, 3/)
- Last tweet: call to action + link

### Hashtag Convention
- 2-3 hashtags per tweet (optimal engagement)
- More than 5 looks spammy, reduces engagement
- Place at end of tweet or woven into text
- Music hashtags: #NewMusic, #NowPlaying, genre-specific

### Tone
- Concise, punchy, conversational
- Personality allowed — don't sound like a press release
- Questions and polls drive engagement
- Emojis OK but don't overdo

## Instagram Rules

### Character Counting
- **Limit**: 2,200 characters per caption
- **Visible preview**: First ~125 characters before "more" tap
- Put the hook in those first 125 characters
- Line breaks count as characters

### Hashtag Convention
- **Optimal**: 15-20 hashtags
- **Maximum**: 30 hashtags (hard limit, post fails above this)
- Place hashtags as a separate block after the caption
- Separate with line breaks or dots for visual spacing
- Mix popular + niche hashtags for reach + targeting

### Hashtag Block Format
```
.
.
.
#NewMusic #HipHop #IndieMusic #MusicRelease #NowPlaying
#AIMusic #NewAlbum #StreamNow #MusicProduction #IndieArtist
```

### Tone
- Visual storytelling — pair with strong image/video
- Longer captions OK if engaging
- Personal, behind-the-scenes angle works well
- Call to action: "Link in bio", "Save this post"

---

## TikTok Rules

### Character Counting
- **Limit**: 4,000 characters
- **Visible without tap**: ~150 characters
- Keep captions short — video is the content
- Under 150 chars = fully visible = better engagement

### Hashtag Convention
- 3-5 hashtags
- Include 1-2 trending/discovery hashtags
- Music-specific: #NewMusic, #MusicTok, genre tags
- Don't use hashtags that are too broad (#fyp is debated)

### Tone
- Casual, authentic, unpolished feel
- Speak like a person, not a brand
- Humor and personality win
- Direct address: "You need to hear this"

---

## Facebook Rules

### Character Counting
- **Limit**: 63,206 characters (effectively unlimited)
- **Visible preview**: First 2-3 lines before "See more"
- Hook must be in those first lines
- Longer storytelling posts perform well

### Hashtag Convention
- 3-5 hashtags (Facebook is less hashtag-driven)
- Place at end of post
- Use for categorization more than discovery
- Don't over-hashtag — looks out of place on Facebook

### Tone
- Longer storytelling acceptable
- More formal than Twitter/TikTok but still personal
- Community-building language
- Questions drive comments and engagement
- Share the story behind the music

---

## YouTube Rules

### Character Counting
- **Description limit**: 5,000 characters
- **Visible preview**: First 2-3 lines (above "Show more")
- Hook + key links in first 2-3 lines
- Rest of description: credits, timestamps, links

### Description Structure
```
[Hook — what the video/track is about]
[Streaming links]

[Credits and details]

[Timestamps if applicable]

[Social links]

#NewMusic #Genre #ArtistName
```

### Hashtag Convention
- 3-5 hashtags
- Displayed above the video title (first 3)
- Use genre + discovery tags
- Don't exceed 15 (diminishing returns)

### Tone
- Informative and organized
- Include credits, collaborator info
- Timestamps for longer videos
- SEO-aware: keywords in first 2 lines

---

## Cross-Platform Guidelines

### Consistency
- Core message should be the same across platforms
- Adapt length and tone to each platform
- Streaming links in every release post
- Album name and artist name always included

### Placeholder Detection
Flag any remaining template placeholders:
- `[Album Name]` — should be replaced with actual album name
- `[Streaming Link]` — needs real URL or "link in bio"
- `[Genre]` — should be specific genre tag
- `[Date]` — should be actual date
- `[Post copy]` — section needs real content

### Common Issues
- **Over char limit**: Shorten or split into thread (Twitter)
- **Too few hashtags**: Add relevant ones (Instagram especially)
- **Too many hashtags**: Trim to platform optimal range
- **Missing call to action**: Add "Listen now", "Stream", "Link in bio"
- **No streaming link**: Add link or "link in bio" reference
- **Generic copy**: Make specific to this album/track

# Custom Mastering Presets
#
# Override or add genre presets for mastering.
# These merge on top of the built-in presets in tools/mastering/genre-presets.yaml.
# Only specify fields you want to change — unset fields inherit from built-in.
#
# Fields per genre:
#   target_lufs  - Loudness target in LUFS (e.g., -14.0)
#   cut_highmid  - EQ cut in dB at 3.5kHz (negative = cut, 0 = none)
#   cut_highs    - High shelf cut in dB at 8kHz (negative = cut, 0 = none)

genres:
  # Example: override rock to be less aggressive
  # rock:
  #   cut_highmid: -1.5        # Less cut than default -2.5

  # Example: add a custom genre
  # dark-electronic:
  #   target_lufs: -12.0
  #   cut_highmid: -3.0
  #   cut_highs: -1.0

  # Example: ambient with even more dynamics
  # ambient:
  #   target_lufs: -18.0       # Override default -16

# Default settings (applied when no genre is specified)
# defaults:
#   target_lufs: -14.0         # Streaming standard
#   cut_highmid: 0
#   cut_highs: 0

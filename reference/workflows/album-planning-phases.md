# Album Planning: The 7 Phases

**Before writing any lyrics or creating tracks**, work through these phases with the user. Each phase requires explicit answers.

## Phase 1: Foundation

**MUST answer before proceeding:**
- Who is the artist? (Existing or new?)
- What genre(s)? (Primary category: hip-hop, electronic, country, folk, rock)
- What album type? (Documentary, Narrative, Thematic, Character Study, Collection)
- How many tracks? (Full album ~10-15, EP ~4-6, Single)
- Is this true-story/documentary? (Determines research requirements)

## Phase 2: Concept Deep Dive

**MUST answer before proceeding:**
- What's the central story/theme/message?
- Who are the key characters or subjects?
- What's the narrative arc or thematic journey?
- What's the emotional core?
- Why this story? (For artist, for audience)

## Phase 3: Sonic Direction

**MUST answer before proceeding:**
- What artists/albums inspire this sound?
- Production style? (Dark/bright, minimal/dense, organic/synthetic)
- Vocal approach? (Narrator, character voices, sung, rapped, mixed)
- Instrumentation palette?
- Mood/atmosphere?

## Phase 4: Structure Planning

**MUST answer before proceeding:**
- Tracklist outline (titles or working titles)
- Track-by-track concepts (1-2 sentences each)
- Narrative/thematic flow across tracks
- Which tracks are pivotal?
- Pacing (building, episodic, consistent intensity)?

## Phase 5: Album Art

**Discuss visual concept:**
- What imagery represents the album?
- Color palette?
- Mood/aesthetic?
- Any symbolic elements?

*(Actual generation happens later - see Album Art Generation workflow)*

## Phase 6: Practical Details

**Confirm:**
- Album title finalized?
- Track titles finalized (or willing to adjust)?
- Research needs? (Documentary albums: RESEARCH.md, SOURCES.md)
- Explicit content expected?
- Distributor genre categories?

## Phase 7: Confirmation

**Required before writing:**
- Present complete plan to user
- Get explicit go-ahead: **"Ready to start writing?"**
- Document all answers in album README

## Planning Checklist

Before creating any track files:
- [ ] All 7 phases completed with explicit answers
- [ ] User confirmed: "Ready to start writing"
- [ ] Album README created with all planning details documented
- [ ] Research plan established (if true-story album)

**The rule**: No track writing until all phases complete and user confirms.

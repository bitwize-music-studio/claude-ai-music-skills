Copyright, Content ID, and handling disputes for AI-generated music.

## Copyright Basics for AI Music

### Who Owns AI-Generated Music?

**Current legal landscape (as of 2025)**:

- **Pure AI output**: Generally not copyrightable (no human authorship)
- **Human-directed AI**: Copyright status unclear, case-by-case
- **Human-AI collaboration**: Human contributions copyrightable

**Practical approach**:
- Document your creative input (prompts, direction, selection, editing)
- Keep records of the generation process
- The more human involvement, the stronger the copyright claim

### What You Can Claim

**Likely copyrightable**:
- Lyrics you wrote (even if AI-assisted)
- Melody/composition you directed with specific prompts
- Selection and arrangement of AI outputs
- Post-production editing and mixing
- Album concept and track sequencing

**Likely not copyrightable**:
- Raw, unedited AI audio output
- AI-generated instrumental with no human direction
- Computer-generated elements without creative selection

## Content ID Systems

### What is Content ID?

Automated systems that scan uploads against a database of registered content:
- **YouTube Content ID**: Video platform
- **Spotify's system**: Audio fingerprinting
- **Audible Magic**: Used by Facebook, Twitch, others

### How It Works

1. You register your music (via distributor)
2. System creates audio fingerprint
3. When someone uploads matching audio:
   - Claim is made
   - Options: Block, monetize, or track

### Registering Your Music

| Platform | Registration Via |
|----------|------------------|
| YouTube | DistroKid ($4.95/song), TuneCore (included), CD Baby (Pro) |
| Spotify | Automatic via distributor |
| Facebook/Instagram | Via distributor |

**Recommendation**: Enable Content ID for all original music.

## Types of Claims You May Encounter

### Your Music Gets Claimed

**Scenario**: You upload, someone else claims it.

**Possible causes**:
1. Sample in AI training data matched
2. Similar melody to existing song
3. Fraudulent claim
4. Legitimate claim (you used copyrighted material)

**Response options**:
1. Dispute (if you believe claim is wrong)
2. Remove claimed content
3. Acknowledge claim (if valid)

### You Claim Someone Else

**Scenario**: Your registered music appears elsewhere.

**Automatic actions** (based on your settings):
- Track only (monitor usage)
- Monetize (ads on their video, revenue to you)
- Block (remove their content)

**Manual review**: Some claims require your decision.

## Handling Disputes

### YouTube Content ID Disputes

**Step 1: Review the claim**
- Check what portion is claimed
- Identify the claimant
- Assess validity

**Step 2: Dispute if invalid**
- Provide explanation
- Include evidence (generation logs, timestamps, prompts)
- Wait for response (30 days)

**Step 3: Appeal if needed**
- Claimant has 30 days to respond
- If they release, dispute resolved
- If they maintain, escalates to legal dispute

**Important**: False disputes can result in copyright strikes.

### Platform-Specific Dispute Processes

| Platform | Process | Timeline |
|----------|---------|----------|
| YouTube | 3-step (dispute, appeal, legal) | 30-90 days |
| Spotify | Contact distributor | Varies |
| SoundCloud | Online form | 7-14 days |
| Bandcamp | Direct with Bandcamp | 7-14 days |

## Mechanical Royalties

### What Are Mechanical Royalties?

Payment for reproduction of a musical composition:
- Physical copies (CDs, vinyl)
- Digital downloads
- Interactive streams (Spotify, Apple Music)

### Who Collects Them?

| Type | Collector |
|------|-----------|
| US Mechanicals | MLC (Mechanical Licensing Collective) |
| International | Various CMOs per country |
| Publishing | Publisher or self-administered |

### For AI Music

**If you wrote the lyrics/melody**:
- Register with MLC (free, US)
- Consider publishing administration (TuneCore, CD Baby)

**If purely AI-generated**:
- Mechanical royalties may not apply (no copyrightable composition)
- Performance royalties likely still applicable

---

## Performance Royalties

### What Are Performance Royalties?

Payment when music is played publicly:
- Radio (AM/FM, satellite, internet)
- Live venues
- Streaming services
- TV/film

### Collecting Performance Royalties

**Join a PRO (Performance Rights Organization)**:
- US: ASCAP, BMI, SESAC
- UK: PRS
- Others: SOCAN (Canada), APRA (Australia)

**Register your songs** with your PRO.

**Note**: PROs require copyrightable works. Pure AI output may not qualify.

## AI Music Disclosure

### Current Requirements

**Platforms requiring AI disclosure** (as of 2025):
- YouTube: Disclosure for realistic synthetic content
- TikTok: AI-generated content labels
- Others: Evolving requirements

### Best Practice

**Recommend disclosure**:
- Album/track description mentions AI generation
- Artist bio notes AI collaboration
- Website has clear disclosure

**Benefits**:
- Transparency builds trust
- Preempts questions
- May be required by future regulations

## Twitter/X

### Post Types That Drive Engagement

| Post Type | When to Use | Why It Works |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Story thread** | Pre-release, behind the scenes | Threads get algorithmic boost; each tweet is a hook |
| **Lyric quote card** | Release week, ongoing | Quotable lines spark shares and replies |
| **"How I made this" thread** | Post-release | Process content builds artist credibility |
| **Poll / question** | Engagement gaps | Algorithm rewards replies; polls are low-friction interaction |
| **Quote retweet with context** | When sharing links | Adds your voice; plain links get suppressed |
| **Audio snippet + text** | Release day, singles | Native media gets priority over external links |

### Copy Structure

- **Lead with the hook** — first 50 characters determine if people stop scrolling
- **One idea per tweet** — don't overload; split into threads if needed
- **End with intent** — tell them what to do (listen, reply, RT)
- **Questions outperform statements** — "What track hit hardest?" > "Check out my new album"

### Algorithm Notes

- Native content (text, images, video uploaded directly) outperforms external links
- Tweets with external links (Spotify, SoundCloud) get suppressed — put the link in a reply or quote-tweet it
- Replies and quote tweets signal engagement; algorithm boosts tweets that generate conversation
- Post frequency: 1-3x daily during campaign, 3-5x weekly otherwise
- Best posting windows: 8-10 AM, 12-1 PM, 5-7 PM (audience timezone)

### Music Discovery Mechanics

- Music Twitter runs on threads, lyric quotes, and "if you like X, try Y" posts
- Fan engagement (replying to listeners) signals authenticity
- Pinned tweet should always be your latest release or streaming link

### Hashtag Strategy

- **1-2 hashtags per tweet** (more reduces engagement)
- **Never start a tweet with a hashtag** — algorithm treats it as low-quality
- Place tags in the tweet body, not in a reply thread
- **Rotate tags** — using the same set every tweet triggers spam detection
- Formula: 1 discovery tag + 1 genre tag

**Discovery tags** (pick one per tweet):
- #NewMusic (gold standard — highest reach)
- #NowPlaying
- #MusicMonday (Mondays only)
- #NewMusicFriday (Fridays only)
- #IndieMusic

**Genre tags by album type:**

| Genre | Tags |
|-------|------|
| Hip-Hop | #HipHop, #Rap, #Bars, #HipHopMusic |
| Electronic | #Electronic, #Synth, #ElectronicMusic, #Techno |
| Folk | #Folk, #FolkMusic, #Acoustic, #IndieFlok |
| Country | #Country, #CountryMusic, #Americana |
| Rock | #Rock, #RockMusic, #IndieRock, #AltRock |
| Dark Cabaret | #DarkCabaret, #Cabaret, #GothicMusic |
| Swing | #Swing, #SwingMusic, #Jazz, #Electro-Swing |
| Opera | #Opera, #ClassicalMusic, #Operatic |

**Tags to AVOID:**
- #MusicPromotion, #SoundCloudPromotion — attracts bots, not listeners
- #FollowBack, #Like4Like — spam signals that tank credibility
- #MusicIsLife, #Beats — too generic, zero discovery value

**AI music tags** — use sparingly, not on every post:
- #AIMusic, #SunoAI, #ClaudeCode
- Position as "AI-assisted artist" not "AI-generated music"
- Lead with the music and story; mention AI as the interesting detail, not the headline

### Indie Artist Tactics

- Build in public: share process, not just products
- Reply to every comment during release week — algorithm rewards this
- Find and engage with similar artists' audiences (genuine interaction, not spam)
- Thread a track-by-track breakdown the week after release
- Pin your streaming link; update it with each release

## Instagram

### Post Types That Drive Engagement

| Post Type | When to Use | Why It Works |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Reel with audio snippet** | Release day, singles | Reels get 2-3x reach vs static posts |
| **Carousel (multi-image)** | Track-by-track, story | Carousel saves/shares signal high engagement |
| **Story with link sticker** | Daily during campaign | Direct traffic driver; 24hr urgency |
| **Behind-the-scenes Reel** | Pre-release, ongoing | Process content humanizes the artist |
| **Album art reveal** | Pre-release (T-3 days) | Visual content native to platform |
| **Lyric graphic** | Post-release ongoing | Shareable, saveable, extends album life |

### Copy Structure

- **First 125 characters are everything** — that's the preview before "more"
- Hook formula: [Emotion/Question] + [What it is] + [Why they should care]
- Body: story, context, behind-the-scenes detail
- CTA: "Link in bio", "Save this for later", "Drop a [emoji] if this hits"
- Hashtag block: separated from caption with line breaks

### Algorithm Notes

- Saves and shares weight more than likes
- Reels get priority placement in Explore and suggested feeds
- Carousel posts get second chances (shown again if swiped but not fully viewed)
- Posting frequency: 3-5x per week for feed, daily Stories during campaigns
- Best posting windows: 11 AM-1 PM, 7-9 PM

### Music Discovery Mechanics

- Instagram is visual-first — pair every post with compelling imagery
- Reels with original audio create discoverability (users find music through Reels)
- Story stickers (polls, questions, sliders) boost engagement signals
- "Link in bio" with a link aggregator (Linktree, etc.) for multiple streaming platforms

### Hashtag Strategy

- 15-20 hashtags per post (optimal engagement range)
- Mix: 5 high-volume (100K+ posts) + 10 medium (10K-100K) + 5 niche (<10K)
- Place as a separate block after the caption, separated by line breaks or dots
- Rotate hashtag sets — don't use the same 20 every time
- Include location-based tags if relevant

### Indie Artist Tactics

- Carousel with one track per slide (cover art + 1-line concept) for album launch
- Use Stories for raw/unpolished content; Feed for polished posts
- Collaborate on Reels with other indie artists for cross-audience exposure
- Save highlight collections: "New Album", "Process", "Live"
- Respond to DMs and comments quickly during release week

## TikTok

### Post Types That Drive Engagement

| Post Type | When to Use | Why It Works |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| **"Listen to this part" clip** | Release day, ongoing | Hook-driven discovery; users seek out full track |
| **Making-of / process video** | Pre-release, ongoing | Behind-the-scenes content is TikTok's currency |
| **Trend-jacking with your audio** | When relevant trends emerge | Existing momentum carries your content |
| **Reaction / first listen** | Post-release | Authenticity resonates; human reaction is compelling |
| **Story time + music** | Concept albums, true-story | Story content has high completion rates |
| **Duet / stitch with fan reactions** | Post-release | Social proof + algorithm boost from interaction |

### Copy Structure

- **Under 150 characters** — that's what's visible without tapping "more"
- Keep it conversational and direct: "This part though." > "Check out the bridge section of my new track"
- Use text overlays on the video itself — most people watch without reading captions
- Captions are secondary to the video content

### Algorithm Notes

- Completion rate is king — short videos (15-30s) with high watch-through get boosted
- First 1-3 seconds determine if someone keeps watching
- Posting frequency: 1-3x daily during campaign, 4-7x weekly otherwise
- TikTok doesn't penalize high posting volume like other platforms
- Best posting windows: 7-9 AM, 12-3 PM, 7-11 PM
- Videos posted at off-peak can still blow up — algorithm is less time-sensitive

### Music Discovery Mechanics

- TikTok is the #1 music discovery platform for Gen Z
- Users search for songs they heard on TikTok on streaming platforms
- Original sounds attached to videos create organic discovery
- "Use this sound" feature lets others amplify your music
- Trending sounds page surfaces new music to millions

### Hashtag Strategy

- 3-5 hashtags per post
- 1-2 discovery tags (#NewMusic, #MusicTok, #IndieMusic)
- 1-2 genre tags
- 1 trending/challenge tag if applicable
- #fyp is debated — use it sparingly if at all

### Indie Artist Tactics

- Show your face — TikTok rewards personality over polish
- The hook must be in the first second (audio or visual)
- Batch-create content: record 5-10 short clips in one session
- Engage with comments; reply with video for boost
- Don't over-produce — raw and authentic outperforms polished on TikTok
- Use trending audio formats but swap in your own music

## Facebook

### Post Types That Drive Engagement

| Post Type | When to Use | Why It Works |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Long-form story post** | Pre-release, release day | Facebook rewards longer engagement time |
| **Video with native upload** | Release day, ongoing | Native video autoplay in feed |
| **Event (album release)** | Pre-release | Creates countdown, reminder notifications |
| **Group post** | Niche communities | Targeted audience, higher engagement rate |
| **Photo album / carousel** | Track-by-track reveal | Multiple images = multiple feed appearances |
| **Live stream** | Release day, Q&A | Facebook prioritizes live content heavily |

### Copy Structure

- **First 2-3 lines visible** before "See more" — put the hook there
- Longer storytelling works well — 150-300 words for release posts
- Personal angle: "Here's why I made this album..."
- Include a direct question to drive comments
- CTA: "What do you think?" or "Drop a comment with your favorite track"

### Algorithm Notes

- Comments and shares weight heavily — more than reactions
- Video (especially live) gets priority placement
- Groups have higher organic reach than Pages
- Posting frequency: 1-2x daily during campaign, 3-5x weekly otherwise
- Best posting windows: 1-4 PM weekdays, 12-1 PM weekends

### Music Discovery Mechanics

- Facebook is community-driven — groups and pages over individual posts
- Events feature is underused for music releases (free promotion to invitees)
- Facebook Watch for longer video content (music videos, behind-the-scenes)
- Sharing in relevant music groups extends reach beyond your network

### Hashtag Strategy

- 3-5 hashtags maximum (Facebook is the least hashtag-driven platform)
- Place at end of post
- Use for categorization, not discovery
- Genre tags more useful than generic music tags

### Indie Artist Tactics

- Create or join genre-specific groups (not just your own fan page)
- Facebook Events for release dates — people get reminded automatically
- Share to personal profile during release week (friends' engagement counts)
- Longer, more personal posts outperform short promotional ones
- Cross-post Instagram Reels to Facebook for dual reach

## YouTube

### Post Types That Drive Engagement

| Post Type | When to Use | Why It Works |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Full track with visualizer** | Release day | YouTube is a streaming platform; full tracks get plays |
| **Lyric video** | Release week | High engagement; viewers watch the full video |
| **Behind-the-scenes / making-of** | Post-release | Supplemental content drives channel subscriptions |
| **Track-by-track commentary** | Post-release (week 2) | Long-form content builds deeper fan connection |
| **Shorts (vertical clips)** | Ongoing | YouTube Shorts compete with TikTok/Reels for discovery |
| **Community post** | Between releases | Polls, images, text — keeps channel active without video |

### Copy Structure

- **Title**: [Track Name] - [Artist] (Official Audio/Lyric Video/etc.)
- **First 2-3 lines of description**: hook + streaming links (visible before "Show more")
- **Full description**: credits, lyrics link, social links, timestamps
- End with subscribe CTA and social links

### Algorithm Notes

- Watch time is the primary ranking signal — longer videos that retain viewers win
- Click-through rate on thumbnails matters as much as the content
- Shorts get separate algorithmic treatment — good for discovery, different from long-form
- Posting frequency: 1-2 long-form per week during campaign; Shorts daily
- Playlists improve session time and keep viewers on your channel

### Music Discovery Mechanics

- YouTube is the world's largest music streaming platform by hours
- Users search for songs by name, lyrics, and genre
- "Mix" and autoplay playlists surface related music to new listeners
- Community posts keep your channel active between video uploads

### Hashtag Strategy

- 3-5 hashtags in description
- First 3 hashtags appear above the video title
- Use: #ArtistName, #AlbumName, #GenreTag
- Don't exceed 15 — YouTube treats excess hashtags as spam

### Indie Artist Tactics

- Consistent thumbnails build brand recognition
- Upload full tracks as "Official Audio" with album art — they rank in search
- Shorts with 15-30s hooks from tracks drive discovery
- Pin a comment with streaming links on every video
- Playlists: create one per album, genre, and mood

## Cross-Platform Strategy

### Release Rollout Types

#### Single Release
```
T-7:  Teaser (Instagram Story, Twitter, TikTok)
T-3:  Snippet / behind-the-scenes (all platforms)
T-0:  Release announcement (all platforms, staggered by 1-2 hours)
T+1:  Behind-the-scenes / making-of content
T+3:  Lyric quote / fan engagement post
T+7:  "One week later" reflection or milestone post
```

#### Album Release
```
T-14: Album announcement + cover art reveal
T-10: Tracklist reveal (carousel/thread)
T-7:  Lead single snippet + pre-save link
T-3:  Track-by-track concept teasers (1 per day)
T-1:  "Tomorrow" countdown post
T-0:  RELEASE DAY — stagger across platforms over 4-6 hours
T+1:  "Thank you" + early reactions/stats
T+3:  Deep cut highlight (lesser-known track)
T+7:  Track-by-track breakdown thread
T+14: "Two weeks in" reflection + streaming stats
```

#### EP Release
```
T-7:  Announcement + cover art
T-3:  Lead track snippet
T-0:  Release across all platforms
T+3:  Behind-the-scenes content
T+7:  Highlight an underplayed track
```

### Campaign Story Arc

Every campaign follows a narrative:

1. **Tease** (T-14 to T-3): Build anticipation without revealing everything
2. **Launch** (T-0 to T+1): Maximum energy, all platforms, clear call to action
3. **Sustain** (T+2 to T+14): Keep the conversation going with supplemental content
4. **Evergreen** (T+14+): Periodic resurfacing — lyric quotes, milestones, "throwback" posts

### Turning Album Themes into Copy

| Album Element | Copy Angle |
|---------------|------------|
| Album concept | "What if [premise]?" — pose the question the album answers |
| Track narratives | "Track 3 tells the story of..." — serialized storytelling |
| Lyrics | Pull the most quotable line — use as standalone post |
| Sonic palette | "We blended [genre] with [genre]..." — for music nerds |
| Inspiration | "This album started when..." — origin story |
| Research (documentary) | "Did you know [fact]?" — educational hook |

### Driving Streams vs Building Audience

These require different strategies:

**Driving streams** (short-term):
- Direct links to streaming platforms
- "Listen now" CTAs
- Track snippets that create urgency to hear the full thing
- Release-day blitz across all platforms

**Building audience** (long-term):
- Process content (how you make music)
- Personality-driven posts (who you are as an artist)
- Community engagement (replying, sharing fan content)
- Consistent posting between releases
- Educational content about your genre or craft

**Balance**: 70% audience-building, 30% stream-driving. Building audience compounds; stream-driving has diminishing returns without an audience.

### AI Music Positioning

How to talk about AI-assisted music on social media:

**Do:**
- Lead with the story, concept, and craft — AI is the interesting detail, not the headline
- "I used AI tools to bring this concept to life" — positions you as the creative director
- Share your creative process (how you directed the AI, what decisions you made)
- Emphasize what's human: the concept, the story, the curation, the emotional intent

**Don't:**
- Lead with "AI-generated music" — it triggers dismissal before they hear it
- Apologize for using AI — confidence in your art matters
- Use AI tags on every single post — let the music stand on its own most of the time
- Engage with "AI isn't real music" debates — it's a losing conversation

**When asked about AI directly:**
- Be honest and specific: "I use Suno for generation and Claude for lyrics and production"
- Frame it as a tool: "AI is my instrument — I still write, direct, and produce"
- Point to the creative decisions you made

### Content Calendar Template

A 2-week release campaign cadence:

| Day | Platform | Content Type | Notes |
|-----|----------|-------------|-------|
| T-14 | Twitter, Instagram | Album announcement | Cover art + release date |
| T-12 | TikTok | Process teaser | Short clip of making the album |
| T-10 | Twitter | Tracklist thread | One tweet per track concept |
| T-8 | Instagram | Carousel | Track concepts with art |
| T-7 | All | Lead single snippet | 15-30s audio + visual |
| T-5 | TikTok | Behind-the-scenes | Raw, unpolished |
| T-3 | Twitter, Instagram | Track teaser #2 | Different track from lead single |
| T-1 | All | "Tomorrow" countdown | Build anticipation |
| T-0 AM | Twitter | Release thread | Album context + streaming link |
| T-0 Mid | Instagram | Release post + Reel | Cover art + audio snippet |
| T-0 PM | Facebook, YouTube | Release post | Longer storytelling version |
| T-0 Eve | TikTok | "It's out" + hook clip | Casual, authentic |
| T+1 | Twitter, Instagram Story | Thank you + early reactions | Gratitude + social proof |
| T+3 | All | Deep cut highlight | Underappreciated track |
| T+5 | TikTok | Making-of clip | Process content |
| T+7 | Twitter | Track-by-track thread | Full breakdown |
| T+10 | Instagram | Fan engagement | "Which track hits hardest?" |
| T+14 | All | Two-week reflection | Stats, gratitude, what's next |

### Engagement Tactics for Indie Artists

1. **Reply to every comment** during release week — it's a signal to every algorithm
2. **Ask questions** instead of making statements — "What's your favorite track?" > "Stream my album"
3. **Share other artists' work** — generosity builds community and reciprocity
4. **Post consistently between releases** — don't go silent for months
5. **Use each platform natively** — don't cross-post identical content everywhere
6. **Show your face and personality** — people follow artists, not brands
7. **Celebrate small wins publicly** — "100 streams!" is relatable and shareable
8. **Create saveable content** — infographics, lyric cards, track breakdowns
9. **Go live** — live content gets priority on every platform
10. **Be patient** — music promotion compounds; the 10th release benefits from the work you did on the 1st

# Mix Polish Presets — Per-Stem Processing Settings
#
# Each stem type defines its own processing chain:
#   vocals:  noise_reduction → presence boost → high tame → compress
#   drums:   click removal → compress (fast attack)
#   bass:    highpass → mud cut → compress
#   other:   noise reduction → mud cut → high tame
#
# gain_db on each stem controls remix balance (0 = unity, positive = louder)
#
# full_mix: Fallback settings when stems are not available
#
# Override per-user: copy to {overrides}/mix-presets.yaml and edit.
# User overrides deep-merge on top of these defaults.

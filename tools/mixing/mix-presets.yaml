# Mix Polish Presets — Per-Stem Processing Settings
#
# Each stem type defines its own processing chain:
#   vocals:  noise_reduction → presence boost → high tame → compress → saturation → lowpass
#   drums:   click removal → compress (fast attack) → saturation
#   bass:    highpass → mud cut → compress → saturation
#   other:   noise reduction → mud cut → high tame → lowpass
#
# gain_db on each stem controls remix balance (0 = unity, positive = louder)
#
# full_mix: Fallback settings when stems are not available
#
# Character effects (all default to off/passthrough):
#   saturation_drive: 0.0-1.0 (0 = off, adds harmonic warmth/grit)
#   lowpass_cutoff: Hz (20000 = off, lower = darker/vintage)
#   stereo_width: multiplier (1.0 = off, <1 = narrower, >1 = wider)
#
# Override per-user: copy to {overrides}/mix-presets.yaml and edit.
# User overrides deep-merge on top of these defaults.
